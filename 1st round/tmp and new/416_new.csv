Such self-praise begs the question of what other alternatives were available to the board in the months that followed Steve Wynn's departure. Though the board acted swiftly when faced with a crisis, the legacy directors apparently failed to change the batteries of the smoke detectors well before the fire broke out."" – ISS, 5/5/18 ""[W]e consider a concerted vote opposing the continued service of a director personally linked to Mr. Wynn and certain of the Company's greater oversight failures would send a more pronounced message that investors seek a clearer break from the status quo."" – Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC, 5/3/18",1,312,sexual harassment
"WYNN, 05LY6L",Elaine Wynn Comments on ISS Recommendation that Wynn Resorts Shareholders WITHHOLD Votes from Legacy Director John J. Hagenbuch,6-May-18,PRN,Elaine Wynn,,"ISS joins independent proxy advisor firm Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (""Glass Lewis"") in supporting Ms. Wynn's call to vote WITHHOLD on legacy director  John J. Hagenbuch at this year's 2018 Annual Meeting. Ms. Wynn believes that Mr. Hagenbuch's role as a longtime member of the Compensation Committee and on the Special Committee responsible for overseeing the investigation into allegations of sexual harassment by his close friend, Stephen A. Wynn, the Company's former Chairman and CEO are problematic and concerning. | legacy directors were not properly attuned to the issue of gender diversity over many years, resulting in a re-composition of the board that is encouraging but clearly overdue. This seems to reflect a short-sighted view of risk, particularly for a company operating at the intersection of the entertainment, hospitality, and gaming industries. In conjunction with the company's longstanding governance shortcomings (as evidenced by a ISS Governance QualityScore rating of 10 over the past five consecutive years), this appears to constitute a material failure in governance and risk oversight on the part of the legacy board."" ""Given that Hagenbuch bears responsibility, along with other legacy directors,  for failing to address longstanding governance and risk oversight shortcomings that appear to have magnified the fallout related to the former founder/CEO's sudden departure, and that the benefits of his continued presence on the board do not seem to outweigh the risks associated with permanence, shareholders are recommended to WITHHOLD votes for Hagenbuch.""",2,"80, 158","sexual harassment, diversity"

SIG,Signet Jewelers issues statement on ongoing arbitration,28-Feb-17,SA,,,"""In response to the distorted and inaccurate media reports, Sterling Jewelers released the following statement: It's critical to understand that an arbitration claim was brought against Sterling in 2008 that alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion. None of the 69,000 class members have brought legal claims in this arbitration for sexual harassment or sexual impropriety. Since its filing, it has never included legal claims of sexual harassment or hostile work environment discrimination. The only claims certified to proceed on a class wide basis relate to alleged gender pay and promotions discrimination. Despite years of litigation, millions of pages of documentation and numerous depositions, claimants' counsel have chosen not to file sexual harassment claims. These allegations publicized by claimants' counsel and reported in the media create a distorted, negative image of the company. Indeed, the distorted and inaccurate picture of our company presented in these allegations does not represent who we are. They involve a very small number of individuals in a workforce of more than 84,000 during the class period, and many allegations go back decades. The company takes any concerns seriously and had - and continues to have - multiple processes in place to receive and investigate allegations of misconduct. We continue to encourage all employees to use these processes to raise any workplace concerns so we can investigate and take appropriate action. Regarding the alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion allegations, our company is guided by our core values of fairness, opportunity, integrity and respect and has created strong career opportunities for many thousands of women working at our stores nationwide. As a result of our employment and advancement programs, as well as our culture, more than 68% of all our store management staff are female, and female participation in management positions continues to grow. Because of our long-term commitment to equal opportunity, we have taken the allegations of pay and promotions discrimination raised in this case very seriously. We have thoroughly investigated the allegations and have concluded they are not substantiated by the facts and certainly do not reflect our culture."" | Signet Jewelers halted; news pending Hundreds of former employees allege sexual harassment discrimination at Kay and Jared jewelry -",2,"346, 19",sexual harassment
