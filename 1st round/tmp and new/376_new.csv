It is operated by 180 Turning Lives Around, Inc., a private Monmouth County nonprofit organization dedicated to serving victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse.

To find out more about 180, visit  www.180nj.org or call 732-264-4111. | Verizon is committed to preventing and raising awareness about domestic violence through its efforts throughout communities. Through HopeLine, Verizon collects used cell phones to be recycled or sold and donates the proceeds in the form of cash grants and pre-paid wireless phones to advocacy groups for use by survivors. Verizon was the first wireless carrier in the nation to collect and recycle old cell phones, and has done so on behalf of survivors of domestic violence since January 1999 -- first in New York and then across the U.S. Through UHopeLine, Verizon has also expanded its recycling efforts to college campuses like Rutgers University. Since 2001, HopeLine has collected more than 8 million phones, properly disposed of 1.7 million no-longer-used wireless phones, and kept more than 210 tons of electronic waste and batteries out of landfills. | In addition, proceeds from HopeLine fund a variety of innovative programs. For example, HopeLine recently awarded grants to provide for: the printing of training documents that assist employers in recognizing and addressing the threat of domestic violence in the workplace; video technology that allows domestic violence's youngest victims, children, to participate in legal proceedings from a safe environment; and startup funding for entrepreneurial survivors of domestic violence attempting to establish small businesses and economic stability. | The Verizon Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Verizon, uses its technology, financial resources and partnerships to address critical social issues with a focus on education and domestic violence prevention. In 2010, the foundation awarded nearly $67 million to nonprofit agencies in the U.S. and abroad. Through Verizon Volunteers, one of the nation's largest employee volunteer programs, Verizon employees and retirees | have volunteered nearly 6 million hours of community service since 2000. The Verizon Foundation also supports the advancement of literacy and K-12 education through its free educational website, Verizon Thinkfinity, which furthers the awareness and prevention of domestic violence while providing relief and safety to survivors.",5,"95, 136, 75, 60, 46","domestic violence, sexual assault"

Increasingly, shareholders are acknowledging the strong business case for board diversity and expect companies to respond,” said Aditi Mohapatra, Strategic Initiatives Manager at Calvert. “The board has, up to now, resisted making diversity an explicit part of its nominating process. We hope that they will reconsider that position in light of the vote.” | Urban Outfitters does not currently have any women or minorities on its six-person board, an anomaly in an industry which serves women and minorities and whose companies typically have boards that are diverse by race and gender.

The resolution also directed the company to periodically review its board’s composition to ensure that it continues to be diverse. | Calvert is a leader within the investment community in advocating for corporate diversity.

Resolution sponsors and co- sponsors have noted that the move is flawed since it appears to be tokenism and it fails to meet the generally accepted standards for board member independence.   | Barbara Krumsiek , president and CEO, Calvert Investments, said:  ""Women and minorities play increasingly significant roles in today's marketplace, accounting for more buying power than ever before.  While Margaret Hayne certainly has the qualifications and experience to represent women's interests, she unfortunately does not satisfy other important governance criteria, namely director independence.  Introducing independent women and minorities into the boardroom will further facilitate innovation in director discussions by injecting new perspectives, skills and experiences that may very well not be present on a board that lacks diversity and/or independence."" | Connecticut Treasurer  Denise L. Nappier said:  ""It is time for Urban Outfitters to stop equivocating and embrace the merits of having a bona fide diverse board of directors. The manner in which the company board is currently handling this issue is a calculated insult, and reinforces the need to change its culture. Our shareholder diversity resolution has, at its core, the recognition that a truly diverse and independent board -- one that includes women and minorities -- is ultimately good for Urban Outfitters' business and long-term shareholder value. As principal fiduciary of the $26 billion Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds with investments in this company, that is what I care about and not bogus representation of diversity."" | The resolution posed to Urban Outfitters' shareholders notes the following: ""Urban Outfitters does not have any women or minorities on its Board of Directors… [The] company's primary competitors, The Gap Inc., Nordstrom, Inc., and Abercrombie & Fitch, have at least one woman and/or racially diverse member on their board of directors...

We could not serve the more than 100 families without the support from our community and business partners.” | For the past five years, UnitedHealthcare employees have donated more than 10,000 pounds of food to Catalyst Domestic Violence Services to raise awareness for the women and children fleeing a violent home who need a safe place to go, to start rebuilding their lives. | “Our employees are grateful for the opportunity to be part of this annual event to benefit Catalyst Domestic Violence Services,” said Pam Jamian, UnitedHealthcare Chico site director. | “I applaud the efforts of UnitedHealthcare and the whole business community as they work together to support victims of domestic violence,” said Teeter. “This food drive, made possible by UnitedHealthcare employees, represents the very best in our community.” | Catalyst Domestic Violence Services helps nearly 1,300 victims of domestic violence annually as they work to leave abusive situations. The not-for-profit organization offers a safe house for domestic violence victims as well as counseling and legal assistance with restraining orders. Established more than 35 years ago, the nonprofit’s two drop centers provide services throughout Butte County in addition to its 28-bed confidential shelter and transitional housing program.

(NYSE: VOYA), announced today that it has partnered with Diversity Lab to support the ""Mansfield Rule,"" an initiative that measures whether law firms are actively considering qualified women and attorneys of color for promotions, senior level hiring and significant leadership roles. The Mansfield rule is inspired by the NFL's Rooney Rule, which has resulted in a 20 percent increase in the likelihood of a diverse candidate filling a head coach vacancy in the NFL. More than forty leading law firms will pilot the program over the next year with a goal of advancing diverse leadership in the legal profession. | The Mansfield Rule assesses whether or not firms consider women or attorneys of color for at least 70 percent of vacant leadership roles in their organization during the review period. Law firms that successfully implement Diversity Lab's criteria will be designated ""Mansfield Certified"" and invited to send their recently promoted leaders to a two-day Client Forum, where they will have the opportunity to develop relationships with and learn from influential in-house counsel at leading businesses in the United States. Voya Financial's legal department is one of more than 60 publicly-traded, private and nonprofit institutions that have committed to attending the Client Forum in late 2018. | The Mansfield Rule is named after  Arabella Mansfield, the first woman admitted to the practice of law in  the United States. The rule was one of the winning ideas from the 2016 Women in Law Hackathon, which was sponsored by Diversity Lab, Bloomberg Law and Stanford Law. | View original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voya-financial-supports- mansfield-rule-initiative-to-advance-diversity-in-law-firm-leadership-300508861.html",6,"98, 20, 110, 105, 47, 7","diversity, Diversity and Inclusion"
