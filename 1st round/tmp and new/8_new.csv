The Tool Kit is designed as a roadmap for Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors to use with individual and institutional clients to develop a tailored investment approach to integrate gender diversity criteria into their investment portfolios. | “We are pleased to provide our clients with this latest Tool Kit,” said Lily Scott Trager, Director of Investing with Impact for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. “As an investment opportunity, gender diversity is about identifying the ways in which achieving balance in representation, empowerment and economic opportunity is material for financial outcomes. With the support of a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, investors can take actionable steps towards incorporating gender diversity into investment decisions in a variety of ways.” | The Morgan Stanley Gender Diversity Investment Framework offers multiple approaches that can be used individually or together: | Gender Diversity as a Screen  – Investors can minimize exposure to companies with poor gender diversity records. This approach may reduce exposure to certain long-term risks within a portfolio, or provide investors with a mechanism to align their investments with a core value or social mission. | Gender Diversity Leaders – In addition to mitigating risks associated with poor practices, investors may also use gender diversity criteria to identify companies with potentially better risk/return profiles. For some investors, it is important to identify companies with leading gender diversity records as a means of achieving both financial return alongside greater gender balance or equality. | Gender Lens Investing – Some investors may wish to more proactively influence gender diversity outcomes. Through this approach, financial decisions are evaluated with the objective of creating greater gender balance and a better world for women and girls. The solutions or themes most commonly associated with gender lens investing are: | Manager & Strategy Selection – Investors seeking to advance gender diversity may choose to seek out portfolio managers or investment firms that are women and/or minority owned. | Whether investors are seeking to mitigate long-term risks or potentially enhance returns by leveraging gender diversity, the Tool Kit aims to clarify the full range of approaches to integrating gender diversity criteria across asset classes within an investment portfolio. | “As greater gender diversity and balance is reached across the macroeconomic landscape and as the business case for gender diversity becomes more apparent, our objective is to help investors position their portfolios to take advantage of these opportunities,” said Lisa Shalett, Head of Investment & Portfolio Strategies for Morgan Stanley. | To learn more about the Gender Diversity Tool Kit, please visit: www.morganstanley.com/ideas/gender- diversity-toolkit | Investing in the markets entails the risk of market volatility.
