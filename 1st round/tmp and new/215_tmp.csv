Rite Aid Corporation,Award,"PCA is Philadelphia’s only child advocacy center for sexually abused children. The nonprofit organization brings together a team of professionals to allow abused children to tell their stories using a coordinated process in a safe and welcoming facility. When a report of child sexual abuse is made in Philadelphia, PCA’s intake team coordinates the investigation with a multi-disciplinary team approach, working closely with representatives from the Philadelphia Police Department’s Special Victims Unit, the Department of Human Services, and mental health and medical professionals on behalf of the victim. | “Chris is the embodiment of what it means to be a voice for the voiceless. Child sexual abuse is a national crisis that changes children’s lives forever. However, thanks to the work of Chris and the PCA, these children can reclaim their lives and ensure that the abuse doesn’t define who they are,” said Bryan Everett, chief operating officer of Rite Aid Corporation and president of The Rite Aid Foundation. “Not only has Chris worked to ensure that PCA fulfills its mission, she has also championed to expand PCA’s facility and provide care for more children than ever before, ensuring justice and healing for the innocent.” | Three years after PCA opened in 1989, Ms. Kirchner took on the role as the Alliance’s executive director. Initially, PCA was housed in a 3,300 square foot space in West Philadelphia with only one forensic interview room that allowed for only one child and family to be seen at a time. Ms. Kirchner made it her mission to advocate for a larger site and ensure PCA could serve every child who has faced sexual abuse. In 2010, the facility moved to a larger space in Center City that served 100 children a month. | In 2013, after seeing the incredible work Ms. Kirchner and PCA had accomplished, the City of Philadelphia built the Philadelphia Safety Collaborative to co-locate PCA and all partner agencies. The state-of-the-art facility houses the Philadelphia Police Department’s Special Victims Unit, the Philadelphia Department of Human Services social workers, child abuse prosecutors and PCA staff. This larger facility allows for 250 children to be served a month. In 2018, PCA responded to 3,274 reports of child sexual abuse, conducted 1,957 forensic interviews and ensured 1,264 children received counseling therapy. | “It is truly an honor to be presented with this KidChamp Award. I am incredibly thankful to The Rite Aid Foundation and KidCents for their support of PCA and our efforts to provide a safe space where children can heal and begin to reclaim their lives,” said Chris Kirchner, executive director, Philadelphia Children’s Alliance. “Our work has helped change how we approach sexual abuse cases for children. I’m so very proud of what we have accomplished and promise to continue advocating to ensure these children continue to get the support and care they deserve.” | As part of her role at PCA, Ms. Kirchner also oversees the Northeast Regional Children’s Advocacy Center (NRCAC), a federal grant project that provides training and technical assistance to communities in the northeastern United States that are interested in developing or maintaining a Child Advocacy Center. In addition, she and members of her management team lead trainings locally and nationally about the topic of child sexual abuse, and the importance of a collaborative response. | Executive Director of Philadelphia Children’s Alliance Honored for Outreach and Advocacy on Behalf of Sexually Abused Children | The Rite Aid Foundation announced today that Chris Kirchner, executive director of the  Philadelphia Children’s Alliance (PCA), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has been awarded its KidChamp Award. Ms. Kirchner was recognized for three decades of advocacy and outreach to ensure healing and justice for sexually abused children in Philadelphia. In recognition of her service, Ms. Kirchner received a $10,000 donation to the Philadelphia Children’s Alliance from The Rite Aid Foundation and a $500 Rite Aid gift card during a special ceremony at Philadelphia Children’s Alliance. | The Philadelphia Children’s Alliance is an independent non-profit organization that promotes healing and justice for sexually abused children in Philadelphia. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we collaborate with our partners in child protection, law enforcement, and medical and mental health services to provide forensic interviews, victim support and counseling services at the Philadelphia Safety Collaborative, a co-located child-friendly facility.

,,"""In response to the distorted and inaccurate media reports, Sterling Jewelers released the following statement: It's critical to understand that an arbitration claim was brought against Sterling in 2008 that alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion. None of the 69,000 class members have brought legal claims in this arbitration for sexual harassment or sexual impropriety. Since its filing, it has never included legal claims of sexual harassment or hostile work environment discrimination. The only claims certified to proceed on a class wide basis relate to alleged gender pay and promotions discrimination. Despite years of litigation, millions of pages of documentation and numerous depositions, claimants' counsel have chosen not to file sexual harassment claims. These allegations publicized by claimants' counsel and reported in the media create a distorted, negative image of the company. Indeed, the distorted and inaccurate picture of our company presented in these allegations does not represent who we are. They involve a very small number of individuals in a workforce of more than 84,000 during the class period, and many allegations go back decades. The company takes any concerns seriously and had - and continues to have - multiple processes in place to receive and investigate allegations of misconduct. We continue to encourage all employees to use these processes to raise any workplace concerns so we can investigate and take appropriate action. Regarding the alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion allegations, our company is guided by our core values of fairness, opportunity, integrity and respect and has created strong career opportunities for many thousands of women working at our stores nationwide. As a result of our employment and advancement programs, as well as our culture, more than 68% of all our store management staff are female, and female participation in management positions continues to grow. Because of our long-term commitment to equal opportunity, we have taken the allegations of pay and promotions discrimination raised in this case very seriously. We have thoroughly investigated the allegations and have concluded they are not substantiated by the facts and certainly do not reflect our culture."" | Signet Jewelers halted; news pending Hundreds of former employees allege sexual harassment discrimination at Kay and Jared jewelry -",2,"346, 19",sexual harassment,SIG - Signet Jewelers issues statement on ongoing arbitration - 28-Feb-17 - SA.pdf

Signet is a founding member of the RAGSF, a multi-stakeholder coalition which seeks to learn about and address critical barriers to the production and trade of artisanal gold from the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa.
