According to Capital One, the data at issue was stored on a cloud-based platform and was able to be accessed by a hacker due to a poorly configured firewall – a mechanism designed to wall off privately operated digital systems.  The breach has led to the exposure of customers' most sensitive information, including social security numbers and linked bank accounts. |  View original content to download multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hagens-berman- alerts-investors-in-capital-one-financial-cof-to-the-firms-investigation-of-data-breach-and-possible-disclosure- violations-300894429.html",3,"27, 79, 9","data breach, data-breach"
COF,Hagens Berman Prominent Class,Action Law Firm Goes After Capital One for Massive Data Breach - 31-Jul,19,Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP,Lawsuit,"Hagens Berman: Prominent Class-Action Law Firm Goes After Capital One for Massive Data Breach  Wednesday, July 31, 2019 10:18:00 PM (GMT) | Seattle-based attorneys at Hagens Berman are taking on Capital One, urging those affected by the bank’s recent massive data breach to join a nationwide investigation and soon-to-be-filed class-action lawsuit. | The Capital One 2019 data breach is the largest amount of data stolen from any bank to date. According to the bank, a Seattle-based hacker and software engineer gained access to more than 100 million U.S. credit card applications, as well as those of 6 million Canadian Capital One customers. Current customers were part of those hit, and reports state that even applications denied by Capital One were accessed by the hacker. | What Data Was Accessed by the Hacker in the 2019 Capital One Data Breach? | Hagens Berman’s attorneys suggest that anyone who believes they may have been affected monitor their financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Capital One has stated that it will be offering free identity protection and credit-monitoring services to those affected by a recent data breach, but details have not yet been made clear. This service may provide limited protection and notification of identity theft, according to the firm’s attorneys. | Many experts are recommending that consumers freeze their credit at all three of the credit bureaus. You may be charged for instituting a freeze. If you are, be sure to keep a record of what you paid to protect yourself from identity theft, as you may be eligible for reimbursement through future legal actions. If you elect to use any pay service because of the Capital One data breach, be sure to save receipts showing your payments. | Read more about the pending legal investigation against Capital One for its massive 2019 data breach.",7,"21, 29, 72, 14, 68, 77, 16",data breach
