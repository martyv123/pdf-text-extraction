It believes that working with men and boys to transform harmful gender norms and unequal power dynamics is a critical part of the solution to achieving gender equality. For the empowerment of women and girls to continue advancing, men and boys must see themselves as partners in the process.  | Dove and Dove Men+Care accelerate action towards unlocking the power of gender equality   Wednesday, June 05, 2019 02:00:00 PM (GMT) | VANCOUVER, June 5, 2019 /CNW/ - At this year's  Women Deliver Conference – the world's largest conference on gender equality and the health, rights and wellbeing of girls and women – leading Unilever brands Dove and Dove Men+Care are demonstrating how they are taking accelerated action towards unlocking the power of gender equality, driving progress and change through a number of new initiatives. | Empowering women and girls is one of the most effective ways to accelerate sustainable development and unlock economic growth.1 However, despite being a fundamental human right and a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world, gender equality remains hundreds of years away, in many cases thanks to harmful norms and stereotypes, including unconscious bias. | Globally, women spend significantly more time than men – sometimes up to ten times as much – on unpaid care, volunteer, and domestic work. The existence of a paternity leave policy alongside the encouragement of men to be involved caregivers is a proven solution to support the redistribution of unpaid care work, a significant enabler of gender equality. New research across seven countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and US) finds that 85 percent3 of fathers say that they would be willing to do anything to be very involved in the early weeks and months of caring for their newly born or adopted child, yet face significant barriers in doing so: | Dove Men+Care's global white paper  Unleashing Men's Power To Care Through Paternity Leave  builds on the findings of State of the World's Fathers  – a biennial study examining global issues surrounding care work – produced by Promundo, which explores the actions required to unstereotype and provide expanded opportunities for men's care, and to advance gender equality. This includes improving access to and uptake of paid paternity leave globally. | In addition, Dove Men+Care and Promundo will launch the Paternity Leave Corporate Task Force , a member-led and owned alliance that aims to identify, promote and bring to scale commercially and societally sustainable solutions that will result in improved access and uptake of paternity leave for all men. The Task Force brings together progressive companies under one vision: their aspiration to help create a world in which dads are enabled and empowered to take paternity leave, so the benefits of men's care and greater gender equality are felt at home, at work and in society more widely. | 1.

(NASDAQ: FOX), related to allegations that Roger Ailes sexually harassed and assaulted women for decades. The investigation concerns whether the company's officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to stop or prevent Mr. Ailes' inappropriate behavior, willfully ignoring the company's alleged culture of misogyny, and misleading investors about payments related to sexual harassment settlements. | Earlier this week, the  New York Times  revealed that the United States attorney's office has convened a federal grand jury to investigate the way Fox News handled payments related to sexual harassment cases to determine whether the company misled investors. According to these reports, the grand jury subpoenaed Mark Kranz, the former chief financial officer for Fox News who oversaw the network's finances when it paid millions of dollars in settlements. Mr. Kranz was appointed CFO by Mr. Ailes in 2004 and resigned from the company last year. | On July 6, 2016, former Fox News anchor  Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Mr. Ailes alleging that Mr. Ailes terminated her as retaliation for refusing his sexual advances. Then, on July 19, reports surfaced that Ailes made ""unwanted sexual advances"" toward Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly at the start of her career.
