,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach,"002508, 005930, 1088... - Barron's Summary - 25-Nov-17 - SA.pdf"

Companies do not pay for the service unless a breach occurs and the service is activated. Additionally, LifeLock does not sell members’ data to outside parties. | Identity theft protection for customers is an important part of a checklist for companies developing data- breach crisis plans. A recent study by Forrester Consulting showed that one in three individuals who were notified that their personal information was part of a data breach reported that they experienced identity theft.1 | Beck added, “We learned through conversations with companies in a variety of industries that the vast majority of time and resources are spent on breach prevention.

In addition, the report highlights that advanced targeted attacks are spreading to organizations of all sizes and variety of personnel, data breaches are increasing, and that attackers are focusing on mobile threats. | Rise of Data Breaches, Lost Devices Concern for the Future | Approximately 1.1 million identities were stolen per data breach on average in 2011, a dramatic increase over the amount seen in any other year. Hacking incidents posed the greatest threat, exposing 187 million identities in 2011 -- the greatest number for any type of breach last year. However, the most frequent cause of data breaches that could facilitate identity theft was theft or loss of a computer or other medium on which data is stored or transmitted, such as a smartphone, USB key or a backup device. These theft-or loss- related breaches exposed 18.5 million identities. | As tablets and smartphones continue to outsell PCs, more sensitive information will be available on mobile devices.

,,"Ponemon and Symantec Find Most Data Breaches Caused by Human and System Errors   Wednesday, June 05, 2013 07:02:00 AM (GMT) | MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 5, 2013) - Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) and the Ponemon Institute today released the 2013 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Analysis  which reveals human errors and system problems caused two-thirds of data breaches in 2012 and pushed the global average to $136 per record1. Issues included employee mishandling of confidential data, lack of system controls, and violations of industry and government regulations. Heavily regulated fields including healthcare, finance and pharmaceutical incurred breach costs 70 percent higher than other industries. | The global cost per compromised customer record was up over the previous year, and the United States total cost per data breach incident was down slightly at $5.4 million. This decline was attributed to the appointment of chief information security officers (CISOs) with enterprise-wide responsibilities, comprehensive incident response plans, and stronger overall security programs. | Click to Tweet : 2013 Cost of a Data Breach Study: Mistakes by people & systems caused most data breaches last year: http://bit.ly/14gaIRR | ""While external attackers and their evolving methods pose a great threat to companies, the dangers associated with the insider threat can be equally destructive and insidious,"" said Larry Ponemon, chairman, Ponemon Institute. ""Eight years of research on data breach costs has shown employee behavior to be one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today, up 22 percent since the first survey."" | The eighth annual global report is based on the actual data breach experiences of 277 companies in nine countries including the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. The nine country and global summary reports can be found at http://bit.ly/10FjDik. All of the data breach incidents studied in the reports occurred in the 2012 calendar year. In order to properly track trend data, the Ponemon Institute does not include ""mega data breaches"" of more than 100,000 compromised records. | Companies can analyze their own risk by visiting  Symantec's Data Breach Risk Calculator  which takes the organization's size, industry, location and security practices into consideration for both a per record and an organizational estimate. | Average cost per data breach varies widely worldwide . Many of these differences are due to the types of threats that organizations face, as well as the data protection laws in the respective countries. Some countries such as Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom and United States, have more established consumer protection laws and regulations to strengthen data privacy and cyber security. United States and Germany continue to incur the most costly data breaches (at an average cost per compromised record of $188 and $199 respectively). These two countries also had the highest total cost per data breach (United States at $5.4 million and Germany at $4.8 million). Mistakes made by people and systems are the main causes of data breach . Together human errors and system problems account for 64 percent of data breaches in the global study, while prior research shows that 62 percent of employees think it is acceptable to transfer corporate data outside the company and the majority never delete the data, leaving it vulnerable to data leaks. This illustrates the large extent to which insiders contribute to data breaches and how costly that loss can be to organizations. Brazilian companies were most likely to experience breaches caused by human error. Companies in India were the most likely to experience a data breach caused by a system glitch or business process failure. System glitches include application failures, inadvertent data dumps, logic errors in data transfer, identity or authentication failures (wrongful access), data recovery | failures, and more. Malicious and criminal attacks are the most costly everywhere . Consolidated findings show that malicious or criminal attacks cause 37 percent of data breaches and are the most costly data breach incidents in all nine countries. U.S. and German companies experience the most expensive data breach incidents caused by malicious or criminal attackers at $277 and $214 per compromised records, respectively, while Brazil and India had the least costly data breach at $71 and $46 per record, respectively. German companies were also most likely to experience a malicious or criminal attack, followed by Australia and Japan. Some organizational factors decrease the cost. U.S. and U.K. companies received the greatest reduction in data breach costs by having a strong security posture, incident response plan and CISO appointment. The U.S. and France reduced costs by engaging data breach remediation consultants. | Symantec recommends the following best practices to prevent a data breach and reduce costs in the event of one: | Press Kit Infographic: Cost of a Data Breach SlideShare: Cost of a Data Breach Data Breach Risk Calculator Information Unleashed Blog: Mistakes Are Costing Companies Millions From Avoidable Data Breaches Data Loss Prevention Solutions Encryption Solutions User Authentication Solutions",11,"20, 85, 54, 23, 62, 83, 34, 246, 141, 19, 39",data breach,NLOK - Ponemon and Symantec Find Most Data Breaches Caused by Human and System Errors - 05-Jun-13 - INW.pdf

,,"Symantec-Sponsored Ponemon Report Finds Negligent Employees Top Cause of Data Breaches in the U.S. While Malicious Attacks Most Costly  Tuesday, March 20, 2012 12:00:00 PM (GMT) | Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) and the Ponemon Institute today released the findings of the 2011 Cost of Data Breach Study: United States, which reveals negligent insiders are the top cause of data breaches while malicious attacks are 25 percent more costly than other types. The study also found organizations which employ a chief information security officer (CISO) with enterprise-wide responsibility for data protection can reduce the cost of a data breach by 35 percent per compromised record. The organizational cost of a data breach was $5.5 million last year. The seventh annual Ponemon Cost of a Data Breach report is based on the actual data breach experiences of 49 U.S. companies from 14 different industry sectors. | Click to Tweet : Ponemon Institute report finds insiders pose greatest data breach threat:  http://bit.ly/xoX1jv | Negligent insiders and malicious attacks are the main causes of data breach . Thirty-nine percent of organizations say negligence was the root cause of the data breaches. For the first time, malicious or criminal attacks account for more than a third of the total breaches reported in this study. Since 2007, they also have been the most costly breaches. Accordingly, organizations need to focus on processes, policies and technologies that address threats from the malicious insider or hacker. | Certain organizational factors reduce the overall cost . If the organization has a CISO with overall responsibility for enterprise data protection the average cost of a data breach can be reduced as much as $80 per compromised record. Outside consultants assisting with the breach response also can save as much as $41 per record. When considering the average number of records lost or stolen, all of these factors can provide significant and positive financial benefits. | Specific attributes or factors of the data breach also can increase the overall cost . For example, in this year's study organizations that had their first ever data breach spent on average $37 more per record. Those that responded and notified customers too quickly without a thorough assessment of the data breach also paid an average of $33 more per record. Data breaches caused by third parties or a lost or stolen device increased the cost by $26 and $22, respectively. | More customers remain loyal following the data breach . For the first time, fewer customers are abandoning companies that have a data breach. However, certain industries are more susceptible to customer churn, which causes their data breach costs to be higher than the average. Taking steps to keep customers loyal and repair any damage to reputation and brand can help reduce the cost of a data breach. | The cost of data breach declined . For the first time in seven years, both the organizational cost of data breach and the cost per lost or stolen record have declined. The organizational cost has declined from $7.2 million to $5.5 million and the cost per record has declined from $214 to $194. | CISO on its executive team and reduced costs of a data breach,"" said Dr. Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute. ""As organizations of all sizes battle an uptick in both internal and external threats, it makes sense that having the proper security leadership in place can help address these challenges."" | The U.S. Cost of a Data Breach Study was derived from a detailed analysis of 49 data breach cases with a range of nearly 4,500 to 98,000 affected records. It takes into account a wide range of direct business costs, including engaging forensic experts, outsourcing hotline support and providing free credit monitoring subscriptions and discounts for future products and services. Indirect costs include in-house investigations and communication, as well as the extrapolated value of customer loss resulting from turnover or diminished acquisition rates. The average cost of a data breach does not apply to catastrophic breaches (study excludes data breaches of more than 100,000 records) given they are not typical of those experienced in the United States. Companies analyzed were from 14 different industries, including finance, retail, healthcare, services, education, technology, manufacturing, research, transportation, consumer, hotels and leisure, media, pharmaceutical and communications. | Companies can analyze their own risk by visiting  Symantec's Data Breach Risk Calculator . Based on seven years of trend data, the calculator takes into account an organization's size, industry, location and security practices to estimate how much a data breach would cost on both a per record and organizational basis.

Symantec Corporation,Survey,"“The adoption of new technology has almost always led to gaps in security, but we’ve found the gap created by cloud computing poses a greater risk than we realize, given the troves of sensitive and business-critical data stored in the cloud. In fact, our research shows that 69% of organizations believe their data is already on the Dark Web for sale and fear an increased risk of data breaches due to their move to cloud,” said Nico Popp, senior vice president, Cloud & Information Protection, Symantec. “Data breaches can have a clear impact on enterprises’ bottom line, and security teams are desperate to prevent them. However, our 2019 CSTR shows it’s not the underlying cloud technology that has exacerbated the data breach problem – it’s the immature security practices, overtaxed IT staff and risky end-user behavior surrounding cloud adoption.” | While the cloud has introduced new efficiencies and capabilities to the enterprise, the CSTR reveals that too many companies are not confronting the security risks that cloud adoption has introduced, including an increased risk of data breaches. Investment in cloud cyber security platforms that leverage automation and AI to supplement visibility and overtaxed human resources is a clear way to automate defenses and enforce data governance principles. However, as the consequences of cyber security become increasingly impactful to business success, it is also time to recalibrate culture and adopt security best practices at a human level. | Companies are struggling to modernize their security practices at the same pace that they adopt cloud – 73% experienced a security incident due to immature practices. Lack of visibility into cloud workloads is the leading cause – an overwhelming majority of survey respondents (93%) report issues with keeping tabs on all cloud workloads. For example, Symantec’s research found that while companies estimate they use 452 cloud apps on average, the actual number is nearly four times higher, at 1,807.
