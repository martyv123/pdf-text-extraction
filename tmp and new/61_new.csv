"002508, 005930, 1088...",Barron's Summary,25-Nov-17,SA,,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach

DELL,Dell Survey Shows Organizations Lack Awareness and Preparation for New European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),11-Oct-16,BW,Dell Technologies,"Conference, Survey, Product/Service, Trade Show","The EU GDPR was adopted by the European Parliament and Council this year, and becomes fully effective in 2018. Below are tips and strategies to help organizations adhere to security disciplines needed for GDPR regulations, so they can protect customer personal information, and avoid the data breaches, heavy fines and loss of reputation that may result from non-compliance: | Protect the perimeter. Deploy next-generation firewalls to reduce the network’s exposure to cyber threats, mitigate the risk of data leaks that could lead to a data breach resulting in stiff penalties assessed under GDPR, and deliver the forensic insight required to prove compliance and execute appropriate remediation following a breach. The Dell SonicWALL next-generation firewalls protect against emerging threats and feature deep packet inspection; real-time decryption and inspection of SSL sessions; adaptive, multi-engine sandboxing; and full control and visualization of applications. | Survey results show that 82 percent of global IT and business professionals responsible for data security at both SMBs and enterprises are concerned with GDPR compliance. Although the majority of global IT and business professionals express compliance concerns, respondents lack general awareness of GDPR, and they are neither prepared for it now, nor expect to be when it goes into effect. | Additional findings show that most organizations don’t feel well-prepared across security disciplines for GDPR compliance. | Deploy a firm access governance solution . The ability to govern access to applications that permit access to EU citizens’ personal data ‒ particularly unstructured data ‒ is a major factor in data security and GDPR compliance. Governance generally requires periodic review of access rights by line-of-business managers and attestation (or recertification) that the permissions align with their job roles and do not compromise data security. The One Identity family of Identity and Access Management solutions provides this level of visibility and control. | Facilitate secure mobile access. Foster the secure flow of covered data while enabling employees to access the corporate applications and data they need in the way they prefer, and with the devices they choose. Enhance data security (while removing access obstructions) by combining identity components, device variables and temporal factors (time, location, etc.) to deliver an adaptive, risk- based approach that ensures the right access all the time, every time, while concurrently improving data protection and GDPR compliance. | Dell Survey Shows Organizations Lack Awareness and Preparation for New European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  Tuesday, October 11, 2016 10:00:00 AM (GMT) | Dell today announced results of a global survey on the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), revealing that organizations ‒ both SMBs and large enterprises ‒ lack general awareness of the requirements of the new regulation, how to prepare for it, and the impact of non- compliance on data security and business outcomes. | “The European Union General Data Protection Regulation is the first update to European data protection laws since 1995, when the Internet was in its infancy and the constantly evolving cyber threats we know today did not exist. This survey reinforces the global lack of general understanding of GDPR, the scope of the regulation, and what organizations need to do to avoid stringent penalties. Results also show that while some organizations ‘think’ they are prepared, they will be in for a rude awakening if they experience a breach or must face an audit and are subject to the consequences of non-compliance with GDPR.” | Control access management. To satisfy GDPR, employees and contractors must have the correct access permission to do their jobs and nothing more. The right identity and access management technologies that facilitate this level of control include multi-factor authentication, secure remote access, risk-based/adaptive security, granular password management, and full control over privileged user credentials and activity. | “This new regulation provides uniform data protection rights across the EU, and, to be in compliance, both European organizations and those outside of Europe that do business there must adopt an adaptive, user- centric, layered security model approach around the tenets of prevent, detect, respond and predict. To be GDPR-compliant, they need security solutions that enable them to prevent attacks, detect a potentially dangerous presence in their networks, respond quickly to that threat, and analyze and report on the health of their networks in real time.”",11,"58, 81, 61, 15, 83, 78, 24, 55, 102, 55, 86","GDPR-compliant, data breach, General data protection regulation, GDPR compliance, Multi-factor authentication"

Privacy lawyers and consultants tell the WSJ that many companies simply aren't ready; the chief compliance officer for First Solar tells the WSJ that the company underestimated what the law would require of it. Allianz's chief privacy officer tells the WSJ that complying, which has cost the company tens of millions of euros, has been a ""mammoth task;"" Accor's data-protection officer tells the WSJ that listing how the company gathers and processes information will be a ""never-ending process."" A US airline executive, who appointed himself chief data-protection officer, since the law requires one, tells the WSJ that the focus has been on inventorying the personal data for frequent fliers; it's not clear if he's referring to his airline specifically or speaking on behalf of all American airlines. The co-founder of a reservation and guest-information service tells the WSJ that the requirements of the law have surprised some smaller US restaurants, who have information on European tourists who visit and the restaurants therefore need to manage their data as they are tech companies.
