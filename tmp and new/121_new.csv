FB,Absolutely everything Facebook executives have said in public could be used by SEC,Washington Post - 03-Jul,18,,"Articles, Reports, Conjecture, Market (SEC, FDS, etc.), Media Summaries, Published Reports, Regulatory","Securities law experts tell the Washington Post that executives lack immunity, so anything that they say in public involves speaking to investors, and the SEC will probably look at what the company and executives said to see if it constitutes inadequate disclosure of the risks the company faced from its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. A former SEC employee tells the Washington Post that if the FTC or DoJ investigations of the company find that Facebook violated customers' privacy to turn a profit without disclosing it, Facebook could be liable for financial fraud. A different former SEC employee tells the Washington post that the timing of revealing data breaches is a ""hot issue"" for the SEC, and the $35M fine imposed on Yahoo this year indicates that the regulator thinks two years is too long to wait for disclosure. Legal experts tell the Washington post that while Facebook claims it was the victim of Cambridge Analytica and not a cyber-breach, there isn't a standard definition of a data breach, and the company still can't mislead investors (by either omission or commission) about potential risks it faces. The article notes that the SEC may also seek to determine if anyone that knew about the situation insider-traded on it before the public was informed.",1,211,data breach

"AAPL, AMZN, FB...",Regulation risk for FANG stocks could jeopardize market leadership,Reuters - 26-Mar,18,,"Articles, Reports, News - US, Media Summaries  Related Stories:","Reuters reported that FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet - have been among the best market performers over the past nine years, but investors are increasingly worried about the potential for government regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. The article cited an analyst who said recent events, including Facebook's data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, could mark the beginning of the end of the FANG market leadership. However, the article said that many investors are still bullish on these technology stocks, as many analysts have not meaningfully changed their expectations for Facebook or Amazon stock. The article also said there has been some divergence of views on the broader technology space, noting semiconductor stocks were hit after fears of a trade war with China may ramp up. However, other analysts said the long-term growth of technology sector remains intact, especially around stocks less likely to get caught up with regulation, such as networking, video games, and cloud computing. StreetAccount notes that tech has been among the best performing groups during the recent market rally. The WSJ reported last month that Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix made up around half of the S&P 500 year-to-date gains at the time, and that the broader tech sector was responsible for three- quarters of all gains. January inflows into tech funds were also the biggest since 2000. Flows have slowed down recently, however. In the week ended 21-Mar, US tech funds saw $158M of net inflows, down from $1.95B the previous week.",1,249,data breach
