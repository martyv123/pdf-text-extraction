While SCA is most common in people over 40 years old, 9,500 cases of SCA happen to children under the age of 18 [5]. Many bystanders mistakenly believe it is best to wait for professional help to arrive to the scene of a SCA. For the best chance of survival, an AED should be used within three to five minutes after collapse [6].  For every minute that passes without CPR and defibrillation, an SCA victim's chance of survival decreases by 7% to 10% [7].  After 10 minutes, very few SCA victims survive [8].   However, being able to provide immediate treatment is crucial, as only 10.6 percent of SCA victims survive [9].
