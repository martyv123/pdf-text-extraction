,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach,"002508, 005930, 1088... - Barron's Summary - 25-Nov-17 - SA.pdf"

IBM,,"IBM & Ponemon Institute: Business Continuity Management Helps Drive Time and Cost Savings Following Data Breaches  Thursday, June 29, 2017 04:00:00 PM (GMT) | ARMONK, N.Y., June 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the results of an IBM sponsored global study examining the impact of business continuity management (BCM) on the cost of a data breach, which revealed that companies using BCM and disaster recovery services reduces the total average time to identify and contain a data breach incident by 78 days, resulting in a total average savings over that response time period of $394,922. The average total cost of data breach with BCM involvement was $3.35 million, significantly less than the $3.94 million cost for companies operating without BCM programs. | BCM is recognized as a valuable addition to data breach incident response planning, according to the study, which was conducted by the Ponemon Institute and surveyed 1,900 individuals from 419 companies in 16 countries. Of the 419 companies, 226 companies self-reported they have BCM involvement in resolving the consequences of a data breach. Of these companies, 95 percent rate their involvement as very significant (65 percent) or significant (30 percent). | ""Executing business continuity management strategies to respond to data breach incidents is increasingly a top business priority for companies worldwide,"" says Laurence Guihard-Joly, General Manager of IBM Global Resiliency Services. ""Automating and orchestrating these disaster recovery and business continuity plans will help to not just protect sensitive data, but also ultimately boost productivity, strengthen competitiveness in the marketplace, and deliver greater return on investment in the long term."" | Cloud-based resiliency orchestration and disaster recovery automation are driving efforts to transform business continuity programs in the age of automation and cognitive computing. The study shows that companies who utilize a BCM program that incorporates disaster recovery automation and orchestration saw a 39.5 percent reduction in average cost per day of a data breach, compared to companies with no BCM or disaster recovery. This represents a net difference of $1,655 per day. | ""Business continuity management continues to play an important role in determining the impact of data breaches that put organizations at risk worldwide,"" says Dr. Larry Ponemon. ""As companies create, develop, and execute their business resiliency strategies going forward, they must consider all possible options to mitigate the effects of a data breach and keep IT infrastructures secure and available for themselves and their clients."" | 95 percent of companies surveyed indicated that uniting their BCM and IT security functions (BCM/cybersecurity cooperation, crisis management expertise across departments, joint cyber- simulation testing) had a significant impact on mitigating the effects of a data breach. The average cost per lost or stolen record can be as high as  $152. With BCM involvement the average cost can be as low as $130. 76 percent of companies surveyed without BCM involvement had a material disruption to business operations. This decreases to 55 percent for companies involving BCM in advance of the data | breach. 52 percent of companies surveyed with BCM involvement said their reputation or brand had been negatively impacted because of a data breach.

IBM,,"IBM & Ponemon Institute: Cost of a Data Breach Dropped 10 Percent Globally in 2017 Study   Tuesday, June 20, 2017 10:00:00 AM (GMT) | CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , June 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) Security today announced the results of a global study exploring the implications and effects of data breaches on today's businesses. Sponsored by IBM Security and conducted by Ponemon Institute, the study found that the average cost of a data breach is $3.62 million globally1, a 10 percent decline from 2016 results. This is the first time since the global study was created that there has been an overall decrease in the cost. According to the study, these data breaches cost companies $141 per lost or stolen record on average. | Analyzing the 11 countries and two regions surveyed in the report, IBM Security identified a close correlation between the response to regulatory requirements in Europe and the overall cost of a data breach. European countries saw 26 percent decrease in the total cost of a data breach over last year's study. Businesses in Europe operate in a more centralized regulatory environment, while businesses in  the United States (U.S.) have unique requirements, with 48 of 50 states having their own data breach laws. Responding to a multitude of regulatory requirements and reporting to potentially millions of consumers can be an extremely costly and resource intensive task. | According to the 2017 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Overview , ""compliance failures"" and ""rushing to notify"" were among the top five reasons the cost of a breach rose in the U.S. A comparison of these factors suggests that regulatory activities in the U.S. could cost businesses more per record when compared to Europe. For example, compliance failures cost U.S. businesses 48 percent more than European companies, while rushing to notify cost U.S. businesses 50 percent more than European companies. Additionally, U.S. companies reported paying over $690,000 on average for notification costs related to a breach - which is more than double the amount of any other country surveyed in the report. | ""New regulatory requirements like GDPR in  Europe pose a challenge and an opportunity for businesses seeking to better manage their response to data breaches,"" said Wendi Whitmore, Global Lead, IBM X- Force Incident Response & Intelligence Services (IRIS). ""Quickly identifying what has happened, what the attacker has access to, and how to contain and remove their access is more important than ever. With that in mind, having a comprehensive incident response plan in place is critical, so when an organization experiences an incident, they can respond quickly and effectively."" | The Cost of a Data Breach Not Down Everywhere | In the 2017 global study, the overall cost of a data breach decreased to  $3.62 million – down 10 percent from $4 million last year.  However, many regions experienced an increased cost of a data breach – for example, the cost of a data breach in the U.S. was $7.35 million, a five percent increase compared to last year. However, the U.S. wasn't the only country to experience increased costs in 2017. | Non-European Countries Experienced Increased Costs: Organizations in the Middle East, Japan, South Africa , and India all experienced increased costs in 2017 compared to the four-year average costs. European Countries Experienced Most Significant Decrease in Costs:  Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. experienced significant decreases compared to the four-year average costs. Australia, Canada and Brazil also experienced decreased costs compared to the four-year average cost of a data breach. | When compared to other regions, U.S. organizations experienced the most expensive data breaches in the 2017 report. | In the Middle East, organizations saw the second highest average cost of a data breach at  $4.94 million – more than 10 percent increase over the previous year Canada was the third most expensive country for data breaches, costing organizations an average of | $4.31 million.  In Brazil data breaches were the least expensive overall, costing companies only  $1.52 million. | Time Is Money: Containing Data Breaches | For the third year in a row, the study found that having an Incident Response (IR) team in place significantly reduced the cost of a data breach, saving more than $19 per lost or stolen  record. The speed at which a breach can be identified and contained is in large part due to the use of an IR team and having a formal Incident Response plan. IR teams can assist organizations to navigate the complicated aspects of containing a data breach to mitigate further losses. | According to the study, how quickly an organization can contain data breach incidents have a direct impact on financial consequences. The cost of a data breach was nearly $1 million lower on average for organizations that were able to contain a data breach in less than thirty days compared to those that took longer than 30 days. Speed of response will be increasingly critical as GDPR is implemented in May 2018, which will require organizations doing business in Europe to report data breaches within 72 hours or risk facing fines of up to four percent of their global annual turnover. | Additional Key Findings from 2017 Cost of a Data Breach Report | By Industry, Healthcare Breaches Most Costly:  For the seventh year in a row, healthcare has topped the list as the most expensive industry for data breaches. Healthcare data breaches cost organizations $380 per record, more than 2.5 times the global average across industries ( $141 per record.) Top Factors Increasing Cost of a Breach:  The involvement of third-parties in a data breach was the top contributing factor that led to an increase in the cost of a data breach, increasing the cost $17 per record. Organizations need to evaluate the security posture of their third-party providers – from payroll to cloud providers to CRM – to ensure the security of employee and customer data. Top Factors Reducing Cost of a Breach:  Incident response, encryption and education were the factors shown to have the most impact on reducing the cost of a data breach. Having an incident response team in place resulted in $19 reduction in cost per lost or stolen record, followed by extensive use of encryption ($16 reduction per record) and employee training ( $12.50 reduction per record).  Positive Impact of Resiliency Orchestration:  Business continuity programs are significantly reducing the cost of a data breach. The overall average data breach cost per day is estimated at $5,064 in this year's study. Companies that have a manually operated Disaster Recovery process experienced an estimated average cost of $6,101 per day.

These digital customer touchpoints are producing new sources of structured and unstructured data well suited for cognitive to inform companies about customers' individual preferences, behaviors and attitudes. In fact, marketing executives listed ""customer insights"" as the primary way they could use cognitive to enhance their customer experience. Instead of seeing cognitive as a wholly separate initiative, CMOs and heads of sales should consider it a component of their Digital Reinvention™ strategy. Enhance employees' business skills, not just their data analytics skills— people with analytical skill sets are in high demand. But because cognitive technologies do the analytical heavy lifting, what marketing and sales may need the most are people with a broad perspective of both company strategy and the nuts and bolts of the business. These employees can more easily discern business implications from cognitive insights and need strong decision-making skills, as well as an empathetic understanding of their customers to consistently deliver their companies' brand promise.   Make cognitive your golden opportunity for collaboration and innovation— implementing cognitive solutions for marketing and sales calls for close alignment among the CMO, head of sales, Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Data Officer or Chief Digital Officer.

IBM,,"IBM Study: Hidden Costs of Data Breaches Increase Expenses for Businesses   Wednesday, July 11, 2018 04:01:00 AM (GMT) | CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) Security today announced the results of a global study examining the full financial impact of a data breach on a company's bottom line. Overall, the study found that hidden costs in data breaches – such as lost business, negative impact on reputation and employee time spent on recovery – are difficult and expensive to manage. For example, the study found that one-third of the cost of ""mega breaches"" (over 1 million lost records) were derived from lost business. | Sponsored by IBM Security and conducted by Ponemon Institute, the 2018 Cost of a Data Breach Study 1 found that the average cost of a data breach globally is $3.86 million,2 a 6.4 percent increase from the 2017 report. Based on in-depth interviews with nearly 500 companies that experienced a data breach, the study analyzes hundreds of cost factors surrounding a breach, from technical investigations and recovery, to notifications, legal and regulatory activities, and cost of lost business and reputation. | ""While highly publicized data breaches often report losses in the millions, these numbers are highly variable and often focused on a few specific costs which are easily quantified,"" said Wendi Whitmore, Global Lead for IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS). ""The truth is there are many hidden expenses which must be taken into account, such as reputational damage, customer turnover, and operational costs. Knowing where the costs lie, and how to reduce them, can help companies invest their resources more strategically and lower the huge financial risks at stake."" | Hidden Figures – Calculating the Cost of a  Mega Breach In the past five years, the amount of mega breaches (breaches of more than 1 million records) has nearly doubled - from just nine mega breaches in 2013, to 16 mega breaches in 2017.3 Due to the small amount of mega breaches in the past, the Cost of a Data Breach study historically analyzed data breaches of around 2,500 to 100,000 lost records. | Average cost of a data breach of 1 million compromised records is nearly  $40 million dollars At 50 million records, estimated total cost of a breach is  $350 million dollars The vast majority of these breaches (10 out of 11) stemmed from malicious and criminal attacks (as opposed to system glitches or human error) The average time to detect and contain a mega breach was 365 days – almost 100 days longer than a smaller scale breach (266 days) | What Impacts the Average Cost of a Data Breach? For the past 13 years, the Ponemon Institute has examined the cost associated with data breaches of less than 100,000 records, finding that the costs have steadily risen over the course of the study.  The average cost of a data breach was $3.86 million in the 2018 study, compared to $3.50 million in 2014 – representing nearly 10 percent net increase over the past 5 years of the study. | The study also examines factors which increase or decrease the cost of the breach, finding that costs are heavily impacted by the amount of time spent containing a data breach, as well as investments in technologies that speed response time. | The average time to identify a data breach in the study was 197 days, and the average time to contain a data breach once identified was 69 days. Companies who contained a breach in less than 30 days saved over  $1 million compared to those that took more than 30 days ($3.09 million vs. $4.25 million average total) | Regional and Industry  Differences The study also compared the cost of data breaches in different industries and regions, finding that data breaches are the costliest in the U.S. and the Middle East, and least costly in Brazil and India.  | One major factor impacting the cost of a data breach in the U.S. was the reported cost of lost business, which was $4.2 million – more than the total average cost of a breach globally, and more than double the amount of ""lost business costs"" compared to any other region surveyed. One major factor impacting lost business costs is customer turnover in the aftermath of a breach; in fact a recent IBM / Harris poll report found that 75 percent of consumers in the U.S. say that they will not do business with companies that they do not trust to protect their data. | For the 8th year in a row, Healthcare organizations had the highest costs associated with data breaches – costing them $408 per lost or stolen record – nearly three times higher than the cross-industry average ($148). | ""The goal of our research is to demonstrate the value of good data protection practices, and the factors that make a tangible difference in what a company pays to resolve a data breach,"" said Dr. Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of Ponemon Institute.

According to the report, the cost of a data breach has risen 12% over the past 5 years1 and now costs  $3.92 million on average. These rising expenses are representative of the multiyear financial impact of breaches, increased regulation and the complex process of resolving criminal attacks.2 | The financial consequences of a data breach can be particularly acute for small and midsize businesses. In the study, companies with less than 500 employees suffered losses of more than $2.5 million on average – a potentially crippling amount for small businesses, which typically earn $50 million or less in annual revenue. | For the first time this year, the report also examined the longtail financial impact of a data breach, finding that the effects of a data breach are felt for years. While an average of 67% of data breach costs were realized within the first year after a breach, 22% accrued in the second year and another 11% accumulated more than two years after a breach. The longtail costs were higher in the second and third years for organizations in highly-regulated environments, such as healthcare, financial services, energy and pharmaceuticals. | ""Cybercrime represents big money for cybercriminals, and unfortunately that equates to significant losses for businesses,"" said Wendi Whitmore, Global Lead for IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services. ""With organizations facing the loss or theft of over 11.7 billion records in the past 3 years alone, companies need to be aware of the full financial impact that a data breach can have on their bottom line –and focus on how they can reduce these costs."" | Sponsored by IBM Security and conducted by the Ponemon Institute, the annual Cost of a Data Breach Report is based on in-depth interviews with more than 500 companies around the world that suffered a breach over the past year.3 The analysis takes into account hundreds of cost factors including legal, regulatory and technical activities to loss of brand equity, customers, and employee productivity. Some of the top findings from this year's report include: | Malicious Breaches – Most Common, Most Expensive:  Over 50% of data breaches in the study resulted from malicious cyberattacks and cost companies $1 million more on average than those originating from accidental causes. ""Mega Breaches"" Lead to Mega Losses:  While less common, breaches of more than 1 million records cost companies a projected $42 million in losses; and those of 50 million records are | projected to cost companies $388 million. Practice Makes Perfect: Companies with an incident response team that also extensively tested their incident response plan experienced $1.23 million less in data breach costs on average than those that had neither measure in place. U.S. Breaches Cost Double: The average cost of a breach in the U.S. is  $8.19 million, more than double the worldwide average. Healthcare Breaches Cost the Most: For the 9th year in a row, healthcare organizations had the highest cost of a breach – nearly $6.5 million on average (over 60% more than other industries in the study). | Malicious Breaches Pose a Growing Threat; Accidental Breaches Still Common The study found that data breaches which originated from a malicious cyberattack were not only the most common root cause of a breach, but also the most expensive. | Malicious data breaches cost companies in the study  $4.45 million on average – over  $1 million more than those originating from accidental causes such as system glitch and human error. These breaches are a growing threat, as the percentage of malicious or criminal attacks as the root cause of data breaches in the report crept up from 42% to 51% over the past six years of the study (a 21% increase). | That said, inadvertent breaches from human error and system glitches were still the cause for nearly half (49%) of the data breaches in the report, costing companies $3.50 and $3.24 million respectively. These breaches from human and machine error represent an opportunity for improvement, which can be addressed through security awareness training for staff, technology investments, and testing services to identify accidental breaches early on. One particular area of concern is the misconfiguration of cloud servers, which contributed to the exposure of 990 million records in 2018, representing 43% of all lost records for the year according to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index5. | A focus on incident response can help reduce the time it takes companies to respond, and the study found that these measures also had a direct correlation with overall costs. Having an incident response team in place and extensive testing of incident response plans were two of the top three greatest cost saving factors examined in the study. Companies that had both of these measures in place had $1.23 million less total costs for a data breach on average than those that had neither measure in place ($3.51 million vs. $4.74 million). | Number of compromised records: Data breaches cost companies around  $150 per record that was lost or stolen. Companies that fully deployed security automation technologies experienced around half the cost of a breach ($2.65 million average) compared to those that did not have these technologies deployed ($5.16 million average).

The company continues to work with the states as they build their own anti-fraud capabilities and will share best practices as it works toward the best interests of the taxpayer. The resumption comes after the company temporarily paused transmissions upon seeing an increase in suspicious filings and attempts by criminals to use stolen identity information to file fraudulent state tax returns and claim tax refunds. During that time, Intuit worked with states that had raised concerns over state tax fraud. After working with third-party security expert Palantir on a preliminary examination of recent fraud activities, Intuit believes that these instances of fraud did not result from a security breach of its systems.

This stands in stark contrast to years past when a data breach was often a fireable offense for CISOs. Other notable results related to this topic include: | More than half (54%) of U.S. CISOs and 44% of U.K. CISOs indicated that they practice their incident response plans at a frequency of once a year or less. Industry best practices call for frequent incident response tests and practice, so teams are ready for the real thing when it happens. When asked, “If you could stop the business for six months and have the luxury of time to execute any security priorities, which areas would you choose to focus on?”, the answer, “Catch up on basic functions like patching and vulnerability scanning,” finished dead last – even though unpatched vulnerabilities are often cited as the most common source of data breaches (57% of all breaches, according to a study by the Ponemon Institute).",3,"24, 62, 124",data breach,KKR - Optiv Survey 58% of CISOs Believe Experiencing a Data Breach Makes Them More Attractive to Potential Employers - 23-Sep-19 - BW.pdf
