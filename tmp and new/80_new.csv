These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from RBI's expectations are detailed in filings of RBI with the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities, such as its annual and quarterly reports and current reports on Form 8-K, and include the following: the length and scope of the impact of the pandemic, including stay at home orders and business closures, other risks related to unforeseen events, such as pandemics, risks related to its international operations; risks related to the availability and cost of capital, risks related to RBI's ability to compete domestically and internationally in an intensely competitive industry; risks related to technology; and changes in applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws or interpretations thereof.
