SSP,Newsy uncovers a broken justice system for sexual assault survivors on tribal lands,4-Oct-19,PRN,The E.W. Scripps Company,,"Newsy uncovers a broken justice system for sexual assault survivors on tribal lands   Friday, October 04, 2019 03:00:00 PM (GMT) | CINCINNATI, Oct. 4, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Over the course of an 18-month investigation into prosecutions of sexual assault on tribal lands, Newsy reporters uncovered breakdowns in the federal and tribal criminal justice systems so severe that sexual perpetrators often received minimal or no punishment and survivors were left with little justice. | U.S. Attorneys are responsible for prosecuting major crimes committed on reservations. Newsy found that in Montana, the U.S. Attorney's office declined to prosecute 64% of sexual assault cases across all reservations from 2013-2018. Most tribal nations have no jurisdiction over those who are legally defined as ""non-Indians."" And most tribal courts are limited to one-year sentences for any crime, including rape. Records obtained from the Fort Berthold tribal prosecutor's office, in North Dakota, show their court handed down sentences for only three cases of sexual assault from 2013 to mid-2018. The sentences ranged from eight days to six months. The 2010 Tribal Law and Order Act allowed tribes to enhance sentencing up to three years, if they meet certain requirements. Yet only 16 of the 319 federally recognized tribal judicial systems have implemented the Tribal Law and Order Act's enhanced sentencing. Even after the Fort Peck Reservation in  Montana implemented enhanced sentencing, tribal prosecutors at Fort Peck didn't file for enhanced sentencing in any sexual assault convictions from 2013 to 2018. The longest sentence was still one year. | Documents, reports and dozens of interviews reveal how the federal government, which is legally required to protect tribal communities, has repeatedly failed to adequately fund and staff tribal justice systems and limited the tribes' ability to prosecute and sentence sexual crimes to the fullest extent. | More than half of American Indian and Alaska Native women report having experienced sexual violence in their lifetimes, yet survivors face a unique set of hurdles when they seek justice for an assault on tribal lands. The Newsy investigation ""A Broken Trust"" takes a deeper look at the impact of a complex, centuries- old relationship between tribal nations and the federal government.  | a-broken-justice-system-for-sexual-assault-survivors-on-tribal-lands-300931281.html",6,"20, 51, 178, 45, 62, 1","sexual crime, sexual-assault, sexual assault, sexual violence"

Scripps Company (NASDAQ: SSP), is the recipient of a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for ""A Broken Trust,"" its investigation into the lack of justice for survivors of sexual assault on tribal lands. | ""A Broken Trust,"" which debuted on Newsy in 2019, is a harrowing investigation into the racial group most likely to be raped in the U.S. ì American Indian and Alaska Native women ì uncovering how race, politics and the law have prevented these survivors from finding justice. For an Indigenous sexual assault survivor on tribal lands, their legal status as an ""Indian"" sends their case through an entirely different justice system, involving federal, tribal and sometimes state authorities and dollars.  | Over the course of an 18-month investigation, Newsy uncovered severe breakdowns in investigations and prosecutions of sexual assaults. | Year after year, tribal law enforcement agencies across the country are woefully understaffed.  In 2018, the federal government reported that tribal courts received less than 5 percent of the funding they needed. Congress has limited the maximum sentence tribal courts can impose for any crime, including rape, to one year. Exclusive records obtained from the Fort Berthold tribal prosecutor's office show the court there handed down sentences for three cases of sexual assault in the past six years that ranged from eight days to six months.  While U.S. attorneys are supposed to help prosecute major crimes in Indian Country, their funding and staffing there has gone down by more than 40 percent in the past seven years.  The team obtained exclusive data from the Department of Justice showing the Montana U.S. Attorney's office declined to prosecute 64 percent of sexual assault cases across Montana reservations from 2013 to 2018.  The team obtained exclusive data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs showing the vast majority of sexual assault cases from 2016 to 2018 on Fort Berthold in North Dakota were unaccounted for.  | From survivors to police, to tribal leaders to federal officials, the Newsy investigation gives a voice to the people involved in this complex system. Documents, reports and dozens of interviews reveal how the federal government, which is legally required to protect tribal communities, has repeatedly failed to adequately fund and staff tribal justice systems and limited the tribes' abilities to prosecute and sentence sexual crimes to the fullest extent.",5,"51, 80, 18, 181, 69","sexual crime, sexual assault"
