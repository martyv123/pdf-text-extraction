Entrants included over 880 stories from 110 countries. Among the honorees: Safe Kicks Initiative - Adolescent Girls Against Sexual Violence (Nigeria), Fear is a Liar (Uganda & Democratic Republic of Congo), and Free Women Writers (Afghanistan). | inspired and empowered. Decisions ""ì Cecelia Choices from Zenafri Limited (Nigeria): This multi-platform, interactive mobile game is targeted at young African women and aims to educate and empower them as they navigate the challenges of poverty, reduced access to education, sexual violence and teen pregnancy. The game series uses storytelling and interactive decision making to guide young women through the process. The combination of entertainment and education is a creative and compelling approach to empowering young women.  Fear is a Liar from Remnant International (Uganda & Democratic Republic of the Congo):  The lives of Congolese women in Uganda is often challenging. Many have been ripped from their homes by soldier husbands and brought to a new country where they are often ostracized and abandoned. Without a home, papers or a job, they are forced to sell their body. Remnant International created a program in 2010 that provides alternate sources of income through sewing and screen-printing trades. In addition, they provide vocational training, as well as tend to the spiritual, physical and emotional needs of the Congolese women through mentorships, financial training and health seminars. Their film, Fear is a Liar, is one of the many ways they inspire, empower and educate these women to strive for more. Field of Dreams from Building Tomorrow (Uganda):  In an effort to build greater self-esteem and confidence in the young girls of Uganda, two Building Tomorrow Fellows created the first of its kind: A football program for girls. Most of the girls, previously expected to rush home after their school day to clean and do domestic chores, can now learn teamwork, conflict resolution and communication skills outside of the classroom. Free Women Writers (Afghanistan): The UN estimates that 90% of Afghan women are victims of violence. The Free Women Writers collective, comprised of Afghan writers and activists, is working to reverse this horrible statistic. Through published books, as well as an on-line platform to share poetry, narrative, journal entries, reports and articles, the group uses storytelling to educate, advocate and ultimately, change lives. Girls Voices Initiative from Lucy Sananai (Kenya): The Girls Voices Initiative trains young girls to speak up and advocate for their rights against Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and child marriage. Lucy Sananai is one of their candidates and shines a light on how her training and newfound voice has been used to educate other girls in Kajiado about their rights, the effects of FGM, as well as how to rise-up to eradicate it in Kenya. My Life of Advocating for the Girl Child from Fatima Gebi (Nigeria):  Fatima is a 17-year-old, self- described African girl-child advocate, stereotype breaker and student. To everyone else, she is an extraordinary wonder working tirelessly as a passionate activist. She leads multiple organizations and provides numerous seminars and talks to enlighten girls and parents about the importance of education. Additionally, she advocates on behalf of a group of abducted African girls to bring them home safely. Safe Kicks Initiative - Adolescent Girls Against Sexual Violence from Girl Pride Circle (Nigeria): In Nigeria, one out of four girls fall victim to sexual violence. The Safe Kicks Initiative is an after-school program that equips adolescent girls with self-defense skills, alongside sexual violence education. To date, 270 adolescent girls have been trained. The same girls drafted an unprecedented community action plan for the prevention of sexual violence, which was adopted by the local government and implemented by Girl Pride Circle ""ì a registered NGO in Nigeria advocating for girls' rights and empowering them to transform their communities. Swapn Pahte ""ì I have a dream from Bright Future (India):  Pooja is a young girl from a tribal village in Dalonda, Bhiwandi-Thane. To improve her family's financial condition, she found a job with an NGO called Bright Future. This organization helps youth build their employable skills and transform their passions into employment. Pooja took this knowledge and brought it back to her village to spark a revolution. She now provides life, education and employment guidance to youth in her village. They Say from All Girls Code (Lebanon):  They Say is an inspiring film created by the All Girls Code initiative which introduces young girls to tech and STEM fields. The film inspires young girls to challenge cultural stereotypes and reach beyond the roles they've been limited to. Turning Periods into Pathways from Days for Girls (Nepal): In Nepal, Chhaupadi is a long-held tradition in which girls banished from their homes while they menstruate, often relegated to isolated sheds or makeshift structures. Not only does the ritual keep girls out of school, which is the single most empowering factor in improving their lives, but they are subject to sub-human conditions. This program, implemented by Days for Girls.org, is working to end the tradition through education and DfG kits. The work empowers girls to defend their right to an education and drive change in their communities. | Accelerated Secondary Education for Women from Africa Educational Trust (ASEW in South Sudan): Due to conflict, poverty and early pregnancy, many women in South Sudan, are unable to attend secondary school. The lack of education leaves them deeply vulnerable. ASEW, a project implemented by Africa Educational Trust in Yambio Town, South Sudan, is an accelerated secondary education program centered around flexible learning times and an active learning methodology with on-site child care. This unique approach to educating those in low- resource, high-conflict areas, resulted in a pilot where ASEW students achieved the highest grades in the state and the 9th highest grades nationally. Brown Girls DO Ballet¬Æ, (USA): What began as a personal photography project to highlight girls of Hispanic, African, Asian, East Indian and Native American ancestry in ballet programs, has now transformed into an artistic movement celebrating the beauty and power of diversity. By redefining a classically Euro-centric art form, generations of diverse ballerinas, alongside their audiences, are now",3,"54, 813, 161","sexual violence, diversity"

""Diversity and inclusion have been core tenets since HP's inception almost 80 years ago. Our commitment to it will never change. The only difference now, is that we are holding our agencies to the same high standards that we hold for ourselves. We are proud of the work done thus far but know there is much more to we can do to advance representation and equality.""ù  | HP Reports Marketing Agency Diversity Scorecard Results   Tuesday, October 02, 2018 01:00:00 PM (GMT) | NEW YORK, Oct. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today at Advertising Week in New York, HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) shared the results of its diversity scorecard, instituted in 2016/2017 to increase representation of women and underrepresented groups supporting the HP business within the marketing community. The participating agencies for 2018 were: BBDO Worldwide, Edelman, Fred & Farid, Giant Spoon and PHD ""ì agencies that represent more than $2B in revenue and 30,000 employees. The scorecard is part of HP's approach to drive systemic change from client to agency to production houses. | Earlier this year, HP unveiled data proving its agency diversity initiative was having a positive impact on the quality of the creative and on consumer engagement. Measuring the impact of HP ads created before and after the launch of the scorecard, Brand Monitor showed an impressive six-point increase in purchase intent and Marketing Mix Analysis, run by Nielsen, captured a 33-point increase in revenue per impression. | The 2017/2018 diversity challenge asked agencies to continue to push for female representation on account and in leadership roles, and to demonstrate significant progress with underrepresented groups globally. This year's results also include an overview of international results across key agency partners, that will become part of benchmark scoring for 2019. | HP is the first company of its kind to mandate diversity targets, as well as track and measure success via its annual scorecard. | To amplify its scorecard results and elevate the voices of diverse creative talent, HP's Kahn will moderate a panel, ""Diversity Has an Inclusion Problem,""ù at Advertising Week in New York on Tuesday, October 2. The panel will feature Wade Davis, former NFL player and LGBTQ advocate, Christina Lowery, CEO of Girl Rising, Free the Bid ambassador Faride Schroeder, as well as participants from HP's #MoreLikeMe initiative, a professional development program created in collaboration with Cannes Lions, designed to build and strengthen diverse talent in the creative industry. The panel will discuss the importance of not only securing diverse talent, but the inclusion required to keep creative talent engaged and motivated. | HP's own work in this space has resulted in the most diverse board in the industry and continued progress in the diversity stats among its leadership team and workforce overall. In addition to sustaining and improving upon the successes made thus far, HP's focus for 2018/2019, alongside its agencies, is to continue to increase the number of underrepresented groups within its account team mix. HP is also adding Europe and Asia diversity data to its scorecard mix, identifying with its agency partners the strategic factors that define diverse teams including socio-economic status, age and sexual orientation. | HP continues to partner with some of the industry's leading diversity advocates, including: the 3% Conference, ADCOLOR, The Association of National Advertisers' (ANA) #SeeHer initiative, the Unstereotype Alliance, The Female Quotient's Girl's Lounge and Free the Bid. HP is focused on growing these partnerships globally and establishing similar scorecards across its vendor community. | For more information about HP's diversity programs, visit  here.

Diverse teams with different perspectives, experiences and ideas are more creative and innovative, resulting in a collaborative and supportive environment. Intel will continue its ongoing commitment to advance diversity and inclusion, collaborate with industry partners on key learnings, and encourage a community of openness, belonging and inclusion. Reaching the goal is also significant given more than 85 percent of Intel's workforce is in technical roles, making the goal more difficult to achieve. | The Start of Intel's Journey:  In January 2015, Intel set a goal to reach full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the U.S. workforce by 2020. Intel committed $300 million to support this goal and the company's broader goal of improving diversity and inclusion in the entire technology industry. As part of the company's deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, Intel invests in programs that expand access to STEM education and opportunities in underserved populations, including pathway programs, grants and mentorship. Additionally, it has invested heavily in internal programs so employees can bring their full experiences and authentic selves to work. | More Context: For full details on the 2018 Diversity & Inclusion Report, visit Intel's Global Diversity and Inclusion web page. To read more about diversity and inclusion at Intel, visit the Intel Diversity in Technology Initiative press kit. | What's New: Intel has achieved full representation in its U.S. workforce two years ahead of its 2020 goal. The company's workforce now reflects the percent of women and underrepresented minorities available in the U.S. skilled labor market. This achievement was the result of a comprehensive strategy that took into account hiring, retention and progression, and is just the beginning for Intel's work in this space. Along with this announcement, Intel is releasing its 2018 Diversity & Inclusion report, highlighting progress made over the course of this journey and the current composition of its workforce. | What the Report Shows:  Intel's 2018 Annual Diversity & Inclusion report illustrates the progress of women and minorities across all levels of the company as company leaders strive to sustain a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment. Since setting the goal, the number of underrepresented minorities and women in Intel's U.S. workforce has increased for the fourth consecutive year. Overall representation of underrepresented minorities at Intel in the U.S. is now at 14.6 percent.",6,"93, 86, 102, 38, 94, 74","Diversity & Inclusion, Diversity and Inclusion"
