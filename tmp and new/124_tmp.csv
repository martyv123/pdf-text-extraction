,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach,"002508, 005930, 1088... - Barron's Summary - 25-Nov-17 - SA.pdf"

"Amazon Web Services, Inc.",Product/Service,"Fortum is a leading power and utilities provider, headquartered in Finland, with more than 2.5 million customers, 9,000 employees, and operates over 150 power plants across 10 countries. Together with thousands of customers, Fortum has built a one-megawatt Virtual Battery, the largest in the Nordics, which is fully operated on top of AWS. The Virtual Battery aggregates and controls usage of energy assets, like household water heaters and electric vehicles, helping Fortum to better balance energy usage across the grid. “With the elasticity and almost infinite storage capacity that AWS delivers, we are able to analyze more data than the entire Finnish smart metering infrastructure combined, resulting in better understanding how our customers use electricity,” said Per Edoff, Chief Digital Officer, Fortum. “Collecting this data on AWS gives us the ability to efficiently address electricity demand and production, helping us reduce costs, ultimately delivering these savings back to our customers in the form of lower energy bills. Additionally, we have been using the Amazon Elasticsearch Service to securely build a data lake. Using machine learning to get more insights from our data, we will be able to extract better understanding of energy usage, helping our customers to save money and helping us to improve our impact on the environment through more advanced scheduling of when we turn our power plants on and off. Now that the new AWS Europe (Stockholm) Region is open we expect to see this innovation accelerate.” | The AWS Europe (Stockholm) Region offers three Availability Zones at launch. AWS Regions are comprised of Availability Zones, which are technology infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations with enough distance to significantly reduce the risk of a single event impacting business continuity, yet near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and are connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault-tolerance. Additionally, local AWS customers with data residency requirements can now store their content in Sweden with the assurance that their content will not move without consent, while customers building applications that comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now have access to another secure AWS infrastructure region in the European Union (EU) that meets the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection.",2,"240, 156","Chief digital officer, General data protection regulation","09TGVY, AMZN - Amazon Web Services Launches New Region in Sweden - 12-Dec-18 - BW.pdf"

,"Other Regulatory, Regulatory, Sector Themes - US Technology","The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted by the EU Parliament on 14-Apr- 16 and is due to take effect 25-May-18. The regulation will replace the existing 1995 Data Protection Directive and standardize the data protection laws across Europe. GDPR will affect firms located within the EU and those that are located outside the EU if they offer goods or services, or monitor the behavior of EU data subjects. Some believe that possible future U.S. legislation for data privacy and protection may be based on the GDPR. We take a look at some of the regulations and the policy changes some companies are making to comply. | Changes from the 1995 Data Protection Directive: | Facebook: On 17-Apr-18, Facebook announced that it was ""introducing new privacy experiences on Facebook as part of the EU's GDPR."" The changes to user and privacy agreements are being touted as similar to the GDPR regulations for those outside the EU. The new terms will be rolled out to the EU this week and the rest of the world ""on a slightly later schedule.""

,"Articles, Reports, News - US, Media Summaries  Related Stories:","Reuters reported that FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet - have been among the best market performers over the past nine years, but investors are increasingly worried about the potential for government regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. The article cited an analyst who said recent events, including Facebook's data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, could mark the beginning of the end of the FANG market leadership. However, the article said that many investors are still bullish on these technology stocks, as many analysts have not meaningfully changed their expectations for Facebook or Amazon stock. The article also said there has been some divergence of views on the broader technology space, noting semiconductor stocks were hit after fears of a trade war with China may ramp up. However, other analysts said the long-term growth of technology sector remains intact, especially around stocks less likely to get caught up with regulation, such as networking, video games, and cloud computing.

,"Articles, Reports, Media Summaries  Related Stories:","The WSJ reports that Google is getting individuals' consent for targeted advertising much faster than other online-ad services are, and as a result, it's attracting ad money. The article says that since the General Data Protection Regulation went into effect 25-May, in a relatively strict interpretation of the law's requirements, Google's DoubleClick Bid Manager has directed some advertisers' money toward Google's marketplace rather than toward some smaller ad agencies, because Google says it can't verify that people who view ads from the smaller firms have given consent.

The article says that Facebook plays a different role than Google does, mostly selling ads directly and then placing them, and the article notes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the vast majority of people were opting in.",1,218,General data protection regulation,"FB, GOOGL - Google appears to be early winner as result of GDPR - WSJ - 31-May-18 - SA.pdf"
