SPLS,Staples updates investigation into previously announced data security incident,19-Dec-14,SA,,,"Staples’ data security experts detected that criminals deployed malware to some point-of-sale systems at 115 of its more than 1,400 U.S. retail stores. Overall, the company believes that approximately 1.16M payment cards may have been affected. Specific stores and dates can be found here. Based on its investigation, Staples believes that malware may have allowed access to some transaction data at affected stores, including cardholder names, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card verification codes. At 113 stores, the malware may have allowed access to this data for purchases made from 10-Aug- 14 through September 16, 2014. At two stores, the malware may have allowed access to data from purchases made from 20-Jul-14 through 16-Sep-14. As a result, Staples is offering free identity protection services, including credit monitoring, identity theft insurance, and a free credit report, to customers who used a payment card at any of the affected stores during the relevant time periods. During the investigation Staples also received reports of fraudulent payment card use related to four stores in Manhattan, New York at various times from April through September 2014.

GDPR will affect firms located within the EU and those that are located outside the EU if they offer goods or services, or monitor the behavior of EU data subjects.

YouTube, and Google.com, but publishers and advertisers that use Google's ad services must also receive consent from their users. Twitter: 17-May-17 Twitter introduced new tools to make user data more transparent, allowing users to access and modify their own data directly, opt out of different types of data usage and sharing. Amazon: Amazon has stated that all Amazon Web Services are GDPR ready. Amazon has also stated that its advertising services business ""will comply with the requirements of GDPR when it comes into effect on May 25, 2018."" Microsoft: Microsoft has ""committed"" to GDPR compliance across their cloud services when enforcement begins on 25-May.

In fact, at least 25 lawsuits have been filed against Sony in U.S. federal courts over the theft of user data from the PlayStation game network.
