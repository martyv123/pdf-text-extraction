,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach,"002508, 005930, 1088... - Barron's Summary - 25-Nov-17 - SA.pdf"

Organizations have responded with ever increasing investments in point defenses that do not or cannot share intelligence with other defenses in the network.

,"Street Takeaways, Street Takeaways - Other  Related Stories:","Shares of JCP are trading off (4.8%) while shares of LOW are off (0.9%) vs the Consumer Discretionary's (0.2%) move lower today, following the announced resignation of JC Penney's Chairman and CEO, Marvin Ellison, to pursue the President/CEO role at Lowe's Companies. Mr. Ellison will remain a director and CEO through 1-Jun, he will step down from his position as chairman of the board effective immediately. JC Penney has elected current Lead Independent Director, Ronald Tysoe, as Chairman of the Board and has created an Office of the CEO with the current CFO/CIO-Chief Digital Officer/Chief Customer Officer/EVP of Supply Chain sharing equal responsibility for the company's day-to-day operations until a new CEO is appointed. While likely a near-term execution/operational headwind for JCP and it appears the JCP board was largely unaware of Mr. Ellison's intentions due to his involvement in last week's earnings conference call, that said, analysts did point to the scoreboard during his tenure that was not necessarily met with much positive investor follow through, as shares were at $8 when he took over, went to $12, and now rest just above $2. Firms suggested that was largely a product of secular challenges in a difficult department store environment and were constructive towards his initiatives, but the marriage between Mr. Ellison and JCP was expected to end, sooner than later, per notes. For LOW, some firms suggested the move was largely expected given Mr. Ellison's extensive home industry experience and is seen as a positive catalyst for LOW shares as well as a better fit than at JCP. Coupled with, what some firms called an overlooked appointment of Richard Dreiling as Chairman of the Board, firms were quite upbeat on the new management team in place at Lowe's. Analysts look for more incremental color on tomorrow morning's earnings call and further detail on specific initiatives, likely at Lowe's mid-December Investor Day event. Notes were a bit mixed on the overall impact vs HD as while improvement is expected given Mr. Ellison's/Mr. Dreiling's track records, it wasn't quite clear if analysts expect the gap to Home Depot to be closed all that significantly.",1,354,Chief digital officer,"HD, JCP, LOW - Street Takeaways - JC Penney CEO Ellison resigning to become Lowe's CEO - 22-May-18 - SA.pdf"
