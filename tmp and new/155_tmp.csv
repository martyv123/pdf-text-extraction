,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach,"002508, 005930, 1088... - Barron's Summary - 25-Nov-17 - SA.pdf"

The article cited an analyst who said recent events, including Facebook's data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, could mark the beginning of the end of the FANG market leadership. However, the article said that many investors are still bullish on these technology stocks, as many analysts have not meaningfully changed their expectations for Facebook or Amazon stock.

The recent hack compromised the personal information of about 80 million U.S. citizens presently or previously insured or employed by Anthem, the complaint states. The law firm’s investigation also recently revealed that the nation’s second largest insurer did not encrypt the data that was stolen. | The 32-page complaint states that named plaintiff and current Anthem customer under Blue Cross Blue Shield, David Liu of Tustin, California, was harmed in having his personal, health, and financial information associated with his health insurance compromised as a result of the Anthem data breach and Anthem’s failure to provide timely and accurate notice. The complaint states that, “Plaintiff would not have given his personal health and financial information to Anthem for his health insurance had Anthem informed him that it lacked adequate computer network and data security to secure his and other Anthem customers’ personal, health and financial information.” | The data breach affects individuals’ names, addresses, Social Security numbers, emails, employment information and income, causing what Loeser considers “likely irreversible damage” to those affected by the breach. “Moreover,” Loeser said, “the harm could last for years because unlike credit card numbers which can be reissued, Social Security numbers are held for life and are extremely difficult to replace.” | Anthem has stated it may be weeks before it contacts all data breach victims. Since Anthem reports about 80 million records of past and present customers and employees were stolen, and Anthem has about 38 million current customers, you should assume that if you are or were an Anthem customer or employee, it is likely that your information was stolen. | Hagens Berman suggests that concerned consumers who are or were insured by Anthem and Anthem employees take immediate steps to prevent identity theft.

The Oath portfolio includes HuffPost, Yahoo Sports, AOL.com, MAKERS, Tumblr, BUILD Studios, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Mail and more. Following the acquisition, Yahoo changed its name to Altaba Inc and its headquarters have been relocated to New York City. Yahoo also reduced the size of its board to five directors. Prior to the closing of the transaction, Yahoo initially transferred these assets to a newly formed subsidiary, Yahoo Holdings Inc. The target business provides information content, on-line search capabilities, maps, shopping and other services. The transaction was subject to Yahoo's shareholders approval, regulatory approval, and other customary conditions. On March 24, 2016, several bidders were rumored to be interested in acquiring the internet business of Yahoo for a reported value of US$10 billion, via an auction. According to sources, Microsoft planned to offer financing to the private equity firms that considered offering bids and has no interest in buying Yahoo. Sources close to Yahoo's board said it wanted US$10 billion in a sale. The strategic bidders included AT&T, Verizon and Comcast, Advent International, Vista Equity Partners, TPG, KKR and other investment firms. On March 28, 2016, according to sources familiar with the matter, Yahoo informed potential buyers of an April 11, 2016 deadline for bids. On April 8, 2016, sources close to the situation said that Verizon Communications was ready to make a bid for Yahoo's core business which it values at less than US$8 billion. On April 9, 2016, unnamed sources said that Yahoo moved the deadline for bids from April 11, 2106 to April 18, 2016. Additionally, it was reported that Yahoo was likely to get bids from Verizon Communications and Alphabet Inc, while AT&T, Comcast and Microsoft would not submit bids. On April 11, 2016, people familiar with the matter reported that Daily Mail & General Trust Plc was in talks about a possible bid for Yahoo. On April 22, 2016, it was reported that more than 10 companies were interested in making a bid for Yahoo's internet business. On May 16, 2016, sources close to the matter said that Warren Buffet was backing a consortium led by Dan Gilbert, Quicken Loans founder, that would bid for Yahoo's internet business. According to multiple reports, Verizon, TPG Capital, KKR, Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners were included in the list of potential bidders. On May 19, 2016, people familiar with the matter said that the bidders would bid around US$2 billion to US$3 billion in the auction, since the bidders have lowered their expected prices following the sale presentations of Yahoo. On May 25, 2016, people familiar with the matter said that AT&T and Liberty Media Corp were interested in acquiring the internet business of Yahoo. On June 7, 2016, Verizon Communications planned to submit a second-round bid of US$3 billion for Yahoo's internet business, citing people familiar with the matter. It was also reported that TPG would submit a second round bid before the deadline. On June 14, 2016, Verizon, AT&T and a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert were set to participate in a third and final round of bidding for the core business of Yahoo. Yahoo hopes to conclude the auction by next month, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. On July 5, 2016, it was reported that the final selection process will take place around July 18, 2016. On July 21, 2016, it was reported that Verizon, Vector Capital Management, and AT&T submitted their bids by Yahoo's deadline. On July 25, 2016, sources said that Verizon Communications and Yahoo were in discussions for a transaction that could be valued at US$5 billion. On the same date, Verizon and Yahoo entered into a definitive agreement. On September 23, 2016, Yahoo announced that the data breach of around 500 million accounts could complicate the merger. On October 6, 2016, it was reported that Verizon Communications was pressing for a US$1 billion discount off its pending US$4.8 billion transaction with Yahoo. On October 14, 2016, Craig Silliman, general counsel of Verizon Communications, has stated that it will be reasonable to change the terms of the acquisition, and sources said that Verizon Communications may withdraw from the deal based on the recent data breach of around 500 million accounts. The European Commission commenced its review and set December 22, 2016 as the provisional deadline for ruling on the transaction. On December 15, 2016, sources mentioned that Verizon was considering a price cut or cancelling the deal after Yahoo reported a second major e-mail hack affecting 1 billion user accounts. On January 18, 2017, it was reported that the deal to buy Yahoo was under threat after the internet company's disclosure of a data breach that affected more than 500 million accounts. On January 23, 2017, Yahoo announced that the deal was expected to close in the second quarter of 2017 due to the work required to meet closing conditions. On February 21, 2017, the companies agreed to reduce | the consideration price by US$350 million and will also share certain legal and regulatory liabilities arising from the data breaches incurred by Yahoo. On April 3, 2017, Verizon Communications confirmed that Yahoo and its AOL division would be grouped under the new brand name Oath. On April 24, 2017, the board of Yahoo recommended its shareholders vote in favor of the transaction and that a special meeting will be held on June 8, 2017. On May 27, 2017, Megan Liberman, Yahoo News' editor in chief, announced that she was leaving the company after the merger. On June 8, 2017, the shareholders of Yahoo approved of the transaction and the deal was expected to be completed on June 13, 2017. Moreover, Yahoo also extended its Dutch auction until June 16, 2017. On June 13, 2017 the transaction was completed. The remaining Yahoo directors are Eric K. Brandt (Chairman), Tor Braham, Catherine Friedman and Thomas McInerney. Thomas McInerney became Yahoo’s Chief Executive Officer, Alexi Wellman became its Chief Financial and Accounting Officer, and DeAnn Fairfield Work became its Chief Compliance Officer. Arthur Chong continues to serve as the Company’s General Counsel and Secretary. Moreover, Yahoo plans to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by June 16, 2017 a Notification of Registration on Form N-8A and a Registration Statement on Form N-2 in order to register as a publicly traded, non-diversified, closed-ended management Investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Yahoo stock will continue to trade under the ticker symbol “YHOO” through June 16, 2017. Altaba Inc will begin trading under the ticker symbol “AABA” starting June 19, 2017.

,Product / Services Announcement,"BOLT Publishes Infographic Offering Tools to Mitigate Risk of Rapidly Increasing Data Breaches at U.S. Small Business  Tuesday, September 27, 2011 01:30:00 PM (GMT) | FARMINGTON, Conn., Sept. 27, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BOLT (Business Owners Liability Team), a leading insurance agency that exclusively protects small business owners, published today a data breach infographic that illustrates the growing threat of these intrusions and thefts at U.S. small businesses. The graphic also details vital steps owners must take to protect their businesses, and themselves, from this mounting and perilous risk. Up until recently, large corporations were the primary victim of data breaches, but recent reports and high profile cyber attacks tell a much a different story. | According to the U.S. Secret Service and Verizon's forensic analysis unit, in 2009 27% of corporate data breaches were targeted at companies with 100 employees or fewer. In 2010, a remarkable 63% of all attacks targeted these small businesses. Similarly, Visa recently shared that 95% of its credit card breaches are against their small business customers. In part, this growing number of breaches at small businesses is a result of cyber criminals discovering that these organizations typically have very weak security due to limited budgets and small or no technical staff. | Added Hammond, ""Not a day goes by where you don't hear in the news that a medical office or other unsuspecting small business has had a data breach. An intrusion or theft of this kind can be the result of a number of security deficiencies that can even include improper handling of data by employees."" | While criminal breaches pose a major threat, the potential loss from non-criminal breaches can be much more expensive. Additionally, although larger corporations can usually weather the ramifications of a data breach, small businesses and their owners are less likely to have the reserves to withstand a significant loss as a result of stolen company funds, the significant costs associated with investigating a breach, legal issues and penalties, client litigations, termination of service from one or more credit card companies, and the immeasurable cost of loosing customer trust.  | BOLT published this latest infographic in an effort to warn its small business customers of both the existence of this very real threat and the potential results of an unwanted third-party intrusion or theft. BOLT is taking this opportunity to detail the three key ways in which owners can help mitigate this risk and the debilitating financial ramifications of a data breach. | Hammond adds: ""While taking steps like these can help protect your business from a data breach, none of them can be effective once a breach has occurred. At that point, the only protection from potential losses you would incur as a victim of cyber crime is a pre-existing insurance plan."" | Please visit http://info.boltinsurance.com/small-business-data-breaches/ to view BOLT's  data breach infographic as well as other important tips and information for protecting a small business.",8,"24, 90, 91, 55, 87, 62, 50, 22",data breach,VZ - BOLT Publishes Infographic Offering Tools to Mitigate Risk of Rapidly Increasing Data Breaches at U.S. Small Business - 27-Sep-11 - PMZ.pdf

Senior executives are 12x more likely to be the target of social incidents, and 9x more likely to be the target of social breaches than in previous years – and financial motivation remains the key driver. Financially-motivated social engineering attacks (12 percent of all data breaches analyzed) are a key topic in this year’s report, highlighting the critical need to ensure ALL levels of employees are made aware of the potential impact of cybercrime. | New analysis from FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3):  Provides insightful analysis of the impact of Business Email Compromises (BECs) and Computer Data Breaches (CDBs). The findings highlight how BECs can be remedied. When the IC3 Recovery Asset Team acts upon BECs, and works with the destination bank, half of all US-based business email compromises had 99 percent of the money recovered or frozen; and only 9 percent had nothing recovered. Attacks on Human Resource personnel have decreased from last year: Findings saw 6x fewer Human Resource personnel being impacted this year compared to last, correlating with W-2 tax form scams almost disappearing from the DBIR dataset. Chip and Pin payment technology has started delivering security dividends:  The number of physical terminal compromises in payment card related breaches is decreasing compared to web application compromises. Ransomware attacks are still going strong: They account for nearly 24 percent of incidents where malware was used. Ransomware has become so commonplace that it is less frequently mentioned in the specialized media unless there is a high profile target. Media-hyped crypto-mining attacks were hardly existent: These types of attacks were not listed in the top 10 malware varieties, and only accounted for roughly 2 percent of incidents.

Much of this is due to the high proliferation of propriety research, prototypes and confidential personal data, which are hot-ticket items for cybercriminals. Nearly 2,000 breaches were analyzed in this year's report and more than 300 were espionage-related, many of which started life as phishing emails. | Malware is big business: Fifty-one (51) percent of data breaches analyzed involved malware. Ransomware rose to the fifth most common specific malware variety. Ransomware – using technology to extort money from victims - saw a 50 percent increase from last year's report, and a huge jump from the 2014 DBIR where it ranked 22 in the types of malware used. Phishing is still a go-to technique: In the 2016 DBIR, Verizon flagged the growing use of phishing techniques linked to software installation on a user's device. In this year's report, 95 percent of phishing attacks follow this process. Forty-three percent of data breaches utilized phishing, and the method is used in both cyber-espionage and financially motivated attacks. Pretexting is on the rise: Pretexting is another tactic on the increase, and the 2017 DBIR showed that it is predominantly targeted at financial department employees – the ones who hold the keys to money transfers. Email was the top communication vector, accounting for 88 percent of financial pretexting incidents, with phone communications in second place with just under 10 percent. Smaller organizations are also a target:  Sixty-one (61) percent of victims analyzed were businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees. | The top three industries for data breaches are financial services (24 percent); healthcare (15 percent) and the public sector (12 percent). | Now in its tenth year, the "" Verizon 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report "" leverages the collective data from 65 organizations across the world.

Each breach leaves a lingering, if not lasting imprint on an enterprise, finds the 2017 Data Breach Digest. | As we found in the Verizon 2016 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), the human element is again front and center this year. Humans continue to play a significant role in data breaches and cybersecurity incidents, fulfilling the roles of threat actors, targeted victims and incident response stakeholders. | Now in its second edition, Verizon's Data Breach Digest details 16 common breach scenarios, inviting the reader to take a behind-the-scenes look at cyber investigations that tell the stories behind the company's annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR). The cases are each told from the perspective of the various stakeholders involved, such as corporate communications, legal counsel, or the human resources professional. | ""Data breaches are growing in complexity and sophistication,"" said  Bryan Sartin, executive director, the RISK Team, Verizon Enterprise Solutions. ""In working with victim organizations, we find that breaches touch every part of an organization up to and including its board of directors. Companies need to be prepared to handle data breaches before they actually happen in order to recover as quickly as possible. Otherwise, breaches can lead to enterprise-wide damage that can have devastating and long-lasting consequences such as a loss of customer confidence or a drop in stock price.""  | ""The Data Breach Digest is designed to help businesses and government organizations understand how to identify signs of a data breach, important sources of evidence and ways to quickly investigate, contain and recover from a breach,"" added Sartin. | 2017 Data Breach Digest scenarios based on type, industry, incident pattern and stakeholder involvement | The report once again confirms that there is a finite set of scenarios that occur with data breaches but many permutations occur within each, leading to an expansive range of damage that can be observed in the aftermath of a data breach. Breaches in the Digest are defined by type of breach, industry, one of nine DBIR incident patterns, and by stakeholder involvement. | This year's 16 data breach scenarios are also classified according to their prevalence and lethality in the field.

""Taking stock of vulnerabilities and putting some simple practices in place will help retailers protect their customers and assets."" | Maintain current compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. (PCI-DSS). Compliance with PCI-DSS requires continuous adherence. This means a daily log review, weekly file- integrity monitoring, quarterly vulnerability scanning and annual penetration testing. To maintain continued compliance, Verizon recommends designating an internal PCI ""champion"" so that compliance becomes part of daily business activities during the holidays -- and every day. Self-validate very carefully – or entrust it to a credible expert.   Top-tier merchants – which process the highest volumes of cardholder transactions – are allowed to assess themselves against the PCI standards.  But due to the numerous issues and conflicts of interest this can cause, Verizon recommends that an objective and credible third party validate the scope of the assessment or perform the testing. Only use third-party security vendors who are credible experts.   Verizon's ""Data Breach Investigations Report' analysis revealed that small businesses and franchises of large chains are most vulnerable to cybercrime. If a third-party vendor manages a retailer's POS systems, the retailer should ask the vendor to confirm that PCI compliance measures are in place. Educate employees so that they can recognize security breaches and help keep security measures active.  In addition to designating an internal PCI champion to ensure that the PCI security standards are being adhered to, employee education is critical for recognizing telltale signs of a breach and to understanding that prevention measures are working. In the era of omni-channel retailing, ensure that online and mobility channels are secure.  Protect public-facing Web assets, which are great for attracting customers, but also magnets for cyberthieves.  Protect in-store mobile assets through mobile-device management that can authorize approved employee access to corporate information, encrypt data, protect against viruses, and remotely lock and wipe devices of critical corporate information. Frequently change administrative passwords on all point-of-sale systems.  Hackers constantly scan the Internet for guessable passwords, so avoid using POS systems to browse the Internet.
