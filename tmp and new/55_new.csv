"002508, 005930, 1088...",Barron's Summary,25-Nov-17,SA,,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach

The article cited an analyst who said recent events, including Facebook's data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, could mark the beginning of the end of the FANG market leadership.

TNL,Risking Exposure,5-Sep-12,PMZ,,Product / Services Announcement,"Numerous data breaches occur frequently in the US, from the recent Yahoo security breach that exposed 450,000 usernames and passwords from a site on the huge web portal, to the hijacking of credit card information belonging to hundreds of thousands of Wyndham Worldwide Corp. customers, to the online theft of 6.5 million user passwords from the popular social networking site LinkedIn. | As the global leader in cyberintelligence, Pennsylvania-based Tiversa sees unreported data breaches of all sizes on a daily basis. ""Not only does data get inadvertently exposed, but Tiversa continues to track viral replication of data over time, from the perspective of file spread itself as well as with cybercriminals worldwide that actively acquire and harvest it,"" says Bob Boback, CEO of Tiversa, cyberintelligence experts, as well as the industry leader in peer-to-peer (P2P) technology that processes as many as 1.8 billion P2P searches per day. | Many states including Maine, Maryland, New York, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Vermont don't even require organizations to report breaches to a centralized database. This might change soon, however, if the recently introduced Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2012 is passed, leading to the adoption of a national standard for data breach notification. Consumers in all states also would be notified of a data breach that could impact them. | While hacking accounts for almost 30 percent of the reported data breaches so far in 2012, according to the ITRC, no one should underestimate the losses taking place through peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing software and networks, which at any point in time have more than 20 million users worldwide. Emerging on the scene in the late 1990s with the introduction of the online music service Napster, P2P networks have since offered a gateway for users worldwide to share digital content—most notably music, movies and software—with other users free of charge.  | ""Some of the best methods companies can institute to try and protect themselves from all types of data breaches include adhering to the red-flag rules, screening employees and having a solid IT security system in place,"" says Carol Fredericks, a Tallahassee, Fla.-based instructor for the FBI-LEEDA program on identity theft. ""Organizations also should adopt more proactive and comprehensive cyber protection that goes beyond traditional measures."" | The entire idea behind stealing personal data is to make money, including completing purchases with credit card numbers, opening new lines of credit with social security numbers and birth dates, draining money from a bank account, obtaining a job or medical treatment, filing a fake tax return to get the refund and more. Consumers might only know they have been affected by a data breach in the form of an email or letter from the source of the breach, from something they see or hear on the news, or when their bank or credit card statement, insurance or credit report arrives. By then, it's usually too late and criminals have had plenty of time to not only use the information themselves but to sell and share it worldwide. | That's where the work on the consumer's behalf begins. ""We find undisclosed losses of data every day and work with the organizations to resolve the issue if the data has been shared globally,"" Boback says. ""Our goal is to detect and remediate data breaches quickly, before cyber criminals have an opportunity to acquire the sensitive data that has been exposed."" | Correcting a problems stemming from a data breach has occurred can be very time-consuming and frustrating for consumers. Often informed long after the breach has occurred, by the organization that suffered the breach requires its customers to contact the fraud department of the company where the breach occurred, as well as the three major credit reporting agencies to place a fraud alert on their credit reports and to order a complimentary credit report. Breach victims are also asked to file a police report that includes documented proof, and to send a copy of that report and all of the supporting documents to any company that lists a fraudulent account on their credit report. | ""When dealing with data-holding organizations, consumers shouldn't assume they would be the first to know about any data breach issue or would be actively working to combat it,"" Boback says. ""From my experience, a small percentage of data-holding organizations have the proper plan in place to handle a data breach situation, including any system in place to monitor for these problems. It's another reason why consumers should always ask about the protection of personal information before just handing it over.""",9,"61, 85, 71, 89, 65, 128, 60, 113, 80",data breach
