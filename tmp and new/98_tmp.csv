(NASDAQ: SYMC) today announced the findings of its Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 17, which shows that while the number of vulnerabilities decreased by 20 percent, the number of malicious attacks continued to skyrocket by 81 percent. In addition, the report highlights that advanced targeted attacks are spreading to organizations of all sizes and variety of personnel, data breaches are increasing, and that attackers are focusing on mobile threats. | Rise of Data Breaches, Lost Devices Concern for the Future | Approximately 1.1 million identities were stolen per data breach on average in 2011, a dramatic increase over the amount seen in any other year. Hacking incidents posed the greatest threat, exposing 187 million identities in 2011 -- the greatest number for any type of breach last year. However, the most frequent cause of data breaches that could facilitate identity theft was theft or loss of a computer or other medium on which data is stored or transmitted, such as a smartphone, USB key or a backup device. These theft-or loss- related breaches exposed 18.5 million identities. | As tablets and smartphones continue to outsell PCs, more sensitive information will be available on mobile devices. Workers are bringing their smartphones and tablets into the corporate environment faster than many organizations are able to secure and manage them. This may lead to an increase in data breaches as lost mobile devices present risks to information if not properly protected.

,,"Ponemon and Symantec Find Most Data Breaches Caused by Human and System Errors   Wednesday, June 05, 2013 07:02:00 AM (GMT) | MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 5, 2013) - Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) and the Ponemon Institute today released the 2013 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Analysis  which reveals human errors and system problems caused two-thirds of data breaches in 2012 and pushed the global average to $136 per record1. Issues included employee mishandling of confidential data, lack of system controls, and violations of industry and government regulations. Heavily regulated fields including healthcare, finance and pharmaceutical incurred breach costs 70 percent higher than other industries. | The global cost per compromised customer record was up over the previous year, and the United States total cost per data breach incident was down slightly at $5.4 million. This decline was attributed to the appointment of chief information security officers (CISOs) with enterprise-wide responsibilities, comprehensive incident response plans, and stronger overall security programs. | Click to Tweet : 2013 Cost of a Data Breach Study: Mistakes by people & systems caused most data breaches last year: http://bit.ly/14gaIRR | ""While external attackers and their evolving methods pose a great threat to companies, the dangers associated with the insider threat can be equally destructive and insidious,"" said Larry Ponemon, chairman, Ponemon Institute. ""Eight years of research on data breach costs has shown employee behavior to be one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today, up 22 percent since the first survey."" | The eighth annual global report is based on the actual data breach experiences of 277 companies in nine countries including the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. The nine country and global summary reports can be found at http://bit.ly/10FjDik. All of the data breach incidents studied in the reports occurred in the 2012 calendar year. In order to properly track trend data, the Ponemon Institute does not include ""mega data breaches"" of more than 100,000 compromised records. | Companies can analyze their own risk by visiting  Symantec's Data Breach Risk Calculator  which takes the organization's size, industry, location and security practices into consideration for both a per record and an organizational estimate. | Average cost per data breach varies widely worldwide . Many of these differences are due to the types of threats that organizations face, as well as the data protection laws in the respective countries. Some countries such as Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom and United States, have more established consumer protection laws and regulations to strengthen data privacy and cyber security. United States and Germany continue to incur the most costly data breaches (at an average cost per compromised record of $188 and $199 respectively). These two countries also had the highest total cost per data breach (United States at $5.4 million and Germany at $4.8 million). Mistakes made by people and systems are the main causes of data breach . Together human errors and system problems account for 64 percent of data breaches in the global study, while prior research shows that 62 percent of employees think it is acceptable to transfer corporate data outside the company and the majority never delete the data, leaving it vulnerable to data leaks. This illustrates the large extent to which insiders contribute to data breaches and how costly that loss can be to organizations. Brazilian companies were most likely to experience breaches caused by human error. Companies in India were the most likely to experience a data breach caused by a system glitch or business process failure. System glitches include application failures, inadvertent data dumps, logic errors in data transfer, identity or authentication failures (wrongful access), data recovery | failures, and more. Malicious and criminal attacks are the most costly everywhere . Consolidated findings show that malicious or criminal attacks cause 37 percent of data breaches and are the most costly data breach incidents in all nine countries. U.S. and German companies experience the most expensive data breach incidents caused by malicious or criminal attackers at $277 and $214 per compromised records, respectively, while Brazil and India had the least costly data breach at $71 and $46 per record, respectively. German companies were also most likely to experience a malicious or criminal attack, followed by Australia and Japan. Some organizational factors decrease the cost. U.S. and U.K. companies received the greatest reduction in data breach costs by having a strong security posture, incident response plan and CISO appointment. The U.S. and France reduced costs by engaging data breach remediation consultants. | Symantec recommends the following best practices to prevent a data breach and reduce costs in the event of one: | Press Kit Infographic: Cost of a Data Breach SlideShare: Cost of a Data Breach Data Breach Risk Calculator Information Unleashed Blog: Mistakes Are Costing Companies Millions From Avoidable Data Breaches Data Loss Prevention Solutions Encryption Solutions User Authentication Solutions",11,"20, 85, 54, 23, 62, 83, 34, 246, 141, 19, 39",data breach,NLOK - Ponemon and Symantec Find Most Data Breaches Caused by Human and System Errors - 05-Jun-13 - INW.pdf

,,"Symantec-Sponsored Ponemon Report Finds Negligent Employees Top Cause of Data Breaches in the U.S. While Malicious Attacks Most Costly  Tuesday, March 20, 2012 12:00:00 PM (GMT) | Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) and the Ponemon Institute today released the findings of the 2011 Cost of Data Breach Study: United States, which reveals negligent insiders are the top cause of data breaches while malicious attacks are 25 percent more costly than other types. The study also found organizations which employ a chief information security officer (CISO) with enterprise-wide responsibility for data protection can reduce the cost of a data breach by 35 percent per compromised record. The organizational cost of a data breach was $5.5 million last year. The seventh annual Ponemon Cost of a Data Breach report is based on the actual data breach experiences of 49 U.S. companies from 14 different industry sectors. | Click to Tweet : Ponemon Institute report finds insiders pose greatest data breach threat:  http://bit.ly/xoX1jv | Negligent insiders and malicious attacks are the main causes of data breach . Thirty-nine percent of organizations say negligence was the root cause of the data breaches. For the first time, malicious or criminal attacks account for more than a third of the total breaches reported in this study. Since 2007, they also have been the most costly breaches. Accordingly, organizations need to focus on processes, policies and technologies that address threats from the malicious insider or hacker. | Certain organizational factors reduce the overall cost . If the organization has a CISO with overall responsibility for enterprise data protection the average cost of a data breach can be reduced as much as $80 per compromised record. Outside consultants assisting with the breach response also can save as much as $41 per record. When considering the average number of records lost or stolen, all of these factors can provide significant and positive financial benefits. | Specific attributes or factors of the data breach also can increase the overall cost . For example, in this year's study organizations that had their first ever data breach spent on average $37 more per record. Those that responded and notified customers too quickly without a thorough assessment of the data breach also paid an average of $33 more per record. Data breaches caused by third parties or a lost or stolen device increased the cost by $26 and $22, respectively. | More customers remain loyal following the data breach . For the first time, fewer customers are abandoning companies that have a data breach. However, certain industries are more susceptible to customer churn, which causes their data breach costs to be higher than the average. Taking steps to keep customers loyal and repair any damage to reputation and brand can help reduce the cost of a data breach. | The cost of data breach declined . For the first time in seven years, both the organizational cost of data breach and the cost per lost or stolen record have declined. The organizational cost has declined from $7.2 million to $5.5 million and the cost per record has declined from $214 to $194. | CISO on its executive team and reduced costs of a data breach,"" said Dr. Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute. ""As organizations of all sizes battle an uptick in both internal and external threats, it makes sense that having the proper security leadership in place can help address these challenges."" | The U.S. Cost of a Data Breach Study was derived from a detailed analysis of 49 data breach cases with a range of nearly 4,500 to 98,000 affected records. It takes into account a wide range of direct business costs, including engaging forensic experts, outsourcing hotline support and providing free credit monitoring subscriptions and discounts for future products and services. Indirect costs include in-house investigations and communication, as well as the extrapolated value of customer loss resulting from turnover or diminished acquisition rates. The average cost of a data breach does not apply to catastrophic breaches (study excludes data breaches of more than 100,000 records) given they are not typical of those experienced in the United States. Companies analyzed were from 14 different industries, including finance, retail, healthcare, services, education, technology, manufacturing, research, transportation, consumer, hotels and leisure, media, pharmaceutical and communications. | Companies can analyze their own risk by visiting  Symantec's Data Breach Risk Calculator . Based on seven years of trend data, the calculator takes into account an organization's size, industry, location and security practices to estimate how much a data breach would cost on both a per record and organizational basis.

In fact, our research shows that 69% of organizations believe their data is already on the Dark Web for sale and fear an increased risk of data breaches due to their move to cloud,” said Nico Popp, senior vice president, Cloud & Information Protection, Symantec. “Data breaches can have a clear impact on enterprises’ bottom line, and security teams are desperate to prevent them. However, our 2019 CSTR shows it’s not the underlying cloud technology that has exacerbated the data breach problem – it’s the immature security practices, overtaxed IT staff and risky end-user behavior surrounding cloud adoption.” | While the cloud has introduced new efficiencies and capabilities to the enterprise, the CSTR reveals that too many companies are not confronting the security risks that cloud adoption has introduced, including an increased risk of data breaches. Investment in cloud cyber security platforms that leverage automation and AI to supplement visibility and overtaxed human resources is a clear way to automate defenses and enforce data governance principles. However, as the consequences of cyber security become increasingly impactful to business success, it is also time to recalibrate culture and adopt security best practices at a human level. | Companies are struggling to modernize their security practices at the same pace that they adopt cloud – 73% experienced a security incident due to immature practices.
