"002508, 005930, 1088...",Barron's Summary,25-Nov-17,SA,,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach

Financial institutions also claim that Target violated Minnesota's Plastic Card Security Act, and that Target's violation of that Act constitutes negligence per se.  The lawsuits seek damages for the costs that financial institutions claim they incurred as a result of the Target Data Breach, such as card reissuance costs, amounts paid to cover fraud losses and other costs incurred by financial institutions as a result of the Breach. | In addition, as part of the Settlement Fund, Target has agreed to pay $19,107,939.38 to fund MasterCard's Account Data Compromise program (ADC program) assessment against Target relating to the Target Data Breach, less any portion of MasterCard's assessment not attributable to Settlement Class Members (a very small portion of the affected MasterCard cards were issued by foreign issuers not part of the class), and to give up its right to challenge that payment as to amounts received by Settlement Class Members.     | What Are Your Other Options?   If you don't want to be legally bound by the settlement, you must exclude yourself by March 1, 2016, or you won't be able to sue, or continue to sue, Target for claims related to the Data Breach.  If you exclude yourself, you can't get money from this settlement.  You can also remain a part of the lawsuit but object to the terms of the settlement.  You must assert any objection by March 1, 2016.  The detailed notice explains how to exclude yourself or object to the settlement. | The Court will hold a hearing on  May 10, 2016, to consider whether to approve the settlement.  The Court will also consider a request for attorneys' fees and costs made by the lawyers representing the class based.  The fees and costs won't reduce the Settlement Fund.  You may ask to appear at the hearing, but you don't have to.

TGT,"Solace Insurance Says Target Credit Card Data Breach Highlights Lack of Cyber Insurance, Leaves Businesses Vulnerable",14-Jan-14,PRN,Solace Insurance,New Products & Services,"Solace Insurance Says Target Credit Card Data Breach Highlights Lack of Cyber Insurance, Leaves Businesses Vulnerable  Tuesday, January 14, 2014 02:00:00 PM (GMT) | In the wake of the massive data breach sustained by Target, the company is now the focus of several class action lawsuits. Solace Insurance says that cyber insurance mitigates financial losses caused by cybercrime incidents including class-action lawsuits, but a majority of small-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) continue to forego insurance. | CLEARWATER, Fla., Jan. 14, 2014 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Target's nationwide data breach, during which at least 70 million customers had of credit and debit card records stolen from the company's servers (1), began during Black Friday shopping week and lasted for several weeks before the company took notice on December 15, 2013.  The aftermath has resulted in the stolen accounts surfacing in underground black markets in recent weeks, selling in batches of one million cards and going for anywhere from $20 to more than $100 per card (2).  Award-winning  Tampa Bay -based insurance agency Solace Insurance says that despite the fact that cyber-attacks such as that suffered by Target are top concerns for businesses in today's technological age, many companies are choosing to forego cyber insurance, leaving them increasingly vulnerable to business collapse and the loss of profits, reputation and public trust due to inability to remediate cyber-attacks because of costs that could become catastrophic.  | Studies have found that while 85 percent of organizations consider cyber-attacks to be their greatest risk, less than 20 percent of companies purchase cyber insurance as a means of protection (3).  Solace Insurance previously deemed large-scale data breaches the future of class action money for lawyers , a sentiment echoed by the announcement that Target's data breach has resulted in three class-action lawsuits, with more than $5 million in damages being sought in the cases (4). | According to Bob Childress, CEO of Solace Insurance and 30-year industry veteran,  cyber insurance mitigates financial and reputation losses such as those sustained by internal and external data breaches.  Childress maintains that as the world has become an internet-centered arena, the propensity of cybercrime has grown, and with it, the need for small to medium-sized enterprises to protect themselves against cyber theft.  Adequate cyber protection, per Childress, consists of several facets, including internet security training for employees—but most importantly, cybercrime insurance coverage.  Cyber insurance has been named as the solution to business continuity plans because of its ability to maintain the financial position held prior to a cyber-attack by reducing the financial losses created by cyber-attacks, including cyber extortion, public relations to repair the insured's reputation and expenses occurred by violation of consumer privacy protection laws. Despite the benefits, Childress says that a majority of small businesses are still opting out of cyber insurance. | ""Data breaches are a growing concern among businesses, yet they seemingly fail to fully grasp the potential risks,"" Childress said.  ""The loss of data is only the beginning—once you factor in the subsequent investigations, lawsuits and the loss of consumer trust, many organizations can be left in dire financial straits.  Cyber coverage helps companies recoup and/or avoid those losses."" | Childress encourages businesses to pursue both first- and third-party insurance:  first-party coverage insures for losses to the policyholder's own data or lost income, or for other harm to the policyholder's business resulting from a data breach or cyber-attack; third-party coverage insures for the liability of the policyholder to third parties, including clients and consumers (5). | Coverage varies between insurers, and while some standard policies may provide some protection from cyber risks, it is important to understand what coverage, if any, is available under existing policies.  Childress says that businesses can limit data breach risks, as well as potential litigation risks, with three simple steps: | 2.

Reaction to the print was generally positive as analysts primarily highlighted impressive US retail comps growth of 1.2%, coming in 70bp ahead of consensus and guidance of flat to up 1%, despite a challenging retail backdrop. While US retail traffic remained negative for the eighth consecutive quarter at (0.4%), analysts were encouraged to see a 90bp sequential acceleration and also consistently pointed out strong digital sales growth, up 30%. Canadian comps growth of 1.6% missed consensus expectations of 3.7%. Though analysts were pleased to see more in-line margin and profitability metrics in Canada, most remain cautious on the segment and expect the upcoming holiday season will be crucial to determining its long-term potential. Initial Q4 comps guidance of 2% came in slightly above consensus 1.7%, while analysts suggested the target could prove conservative given promising trends exiting the quarter such as improving traffic and digital contribution. Analysts also note that easing comparisons against last year's data breach should provide a comps tailwind for the next several quarters. Looking further ahead, analysts were fairly constructive around the company's growth initiatives, including build out of omni-channel capabilities, merchandising focus on key categories, localization and personalization, and SG&A expense optimization. We tracked a number of upward price target revisions driven by both higher out year earnings estimates as well as some modest multiple expansion.

Comps growth of 3.8% outpaced FactSet consensus by 80bp driven by strong performance in key categories, positive traffic growth of 3.2%, better than expected digital sales, and improving momentum toward the end of the quarter. Analysts were particularly pleased with gross margins of 28.5% coming in 50bp ahead of consensus and representing 90bp of y/y expansion, driven by favorable mix. However, analysts did note that both comps and margins benefited significantly from the lapping of last year's data breach markdowns. Reaction to the quarter was generally positive as analysts were pleased to see the company drive a re-acceleration in comps growth, likely signaling share gains over the holiday season. Initial Q1 EPS guidance of $0.95-1.05 bracketed FactSet consensus $1.04, while the comps growth target of ~2.0% was roughly in-line with expectations. Analysts were pleased with the solid result and guide and expect investors will be looking for improvements to the overall margin structure to drive longer-term earnings growth, particularly in light of expectations for potential near-term investments to maintain comps momentum. Given the company's relatively new management team and recent decision to discontinue its Canadian operations, analysts are now primarily focused on the upcoming Analyst Day on 3- Mar to hear an update on corporate strategy going forward. Most are expecting greater color around efforts to improve traffic trends as well as initial F15 guidance.

Austin, a current member of Target’s board of directors, has been appointed as interim non-executive chair of the board. Both will serve in their roles until permanent replacements are named. We have asked Gregg Steinhafel to serve in an advisory capacity during this transition and he has graciously agreed. The board is deeply grateful to Gregg for his significant contributions and outstanding service throughout his notable 35-year career with the company. We believe his passion for the team and relentless focus on the guest have established Target as a leader in the retail industry. Gregg has created a culture that fosters innovation and supports the development of new ideas. Under his leadership, the company has not only enhanced its ability to execute, but has broadened its strategic horizons. He also led the company through unprecedented challenges, navigating the financial recession, reacting to challenges with Target’s expansion into Canada, and successfully defending the company through a high-profile proxy battle. Most recently, Gregg led the response to Target’s 2013 data breach. He held himself personally accountable and pledged that Target would emerge a better company. We are grateful to him for his tireless leadership and will always consider him a member of the Target family. The board will continue to be actively engaged with the leadership team to drive Target’s future success and will manage the transition.

The Company reported adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations1 (Adjusted EPS) of $1.52, an increase of 2.1 percent from $1.49 in 2014. Full-year Adjusted EPS of $4.69 was 11.3 percent higher than $4.22 in 2014. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $2.31 in fourth quarter and $5.25 for full- year 2015, compared with $1.49 and $3.83 in 2014, respectively. Fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations include the gain on the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses and data breach and restructuring expenses that were excluded from Adjusted EPS.

See the “Discontinued Operations” and “Miscellaneous” sections of this release, as well as the tables of this release, for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS. | In first quarter 2016, Target expects both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25, compared with first quarter 2015 GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 and Adjusted EPS of $1.10. For full-year 2016, Target expects GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $5.20 to $5.40, compared with full-year 2015 GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $5.25 and Adjusted EPS of $4.69.

However, results softened meaningfully following our December announcement of a data breach. As we plan for the new fiscal year, we will continue to work tirelessly to win back the confidence of our guests and deliver irresistible merchandise and offers, and we are encouraged that sales trends have improved in recent weeks.” |   1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (""Adjusted EPS""), a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations, such as expenses related to the data breach and the reduction in the beneficial interest asset.   | In first quarter 2014, the Company expects Adjusted EPS of 60 cents to 75 cents, reflecting operating results in our U.S. and Canadian Segments. This measure excludes approximately (2) cents related to the expected reduction of the beneficial interest asset2, as well as any net expenses related to the data breach. For full-year 2014, Target expects Adjusted EPS of $3.85 to $4.15, reflecting operating results in our U.S. and Canadian Segments. This measure excludes approximately (7) cents related to the expected reduction of the beneficial interest asset2, as well as any net expenses related to the data breach. | At this time, the Company is not able to estimate future expenses related to the data breach. Expenses may include payments associated with potential claims by the payment card networks for alleged counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card re-issuance costs), REDcard fraud and card re-issuance expense, payments associated with civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings, expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees, and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. These costs may have a material adverse effect on Target’s results of operations in first quarter and full-year 2014 and future periods. | During fourth quarter 2013, Target experienced a data breach in which an intruder gained unauthorized access to our network and stole certain payment card and other guest information. The Company incurred $17 million of net expense in the fourth quarter, reflecting $61 million of total expenses partially offset by the recognition of a $44 million insurance receivable. These expenses include costs related to investigating the data breach, offering credit-monitoring and identity-theft protection services to our guests, increased staffing in our call centers, procurement of legal and other professional services, REDcard fraud losses and card replacement costs, and an accrual for a probable loss on payment card networks’ anticipated claims for operating expenses incurred as a result of the data breach. This accrual was based on an expectation of reaching negotiated settlements of the payment card networks’ potential claims for alleged non-ordinary course operating expenses associated with the data breach, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these claims were they to be litigated. It does not include any amounts for the potential claims by the payment card networks for counterfeit fraud losses. At this time we are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses on the payment card networks’ potential claims in excess of the amount accrued. | Statements in this release regarding first quarter and full-year 2014 earnings guidance and the impact of the data breach on the Company’s results of operations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This measure excludes approximately (2) cents related to the expected reduction of the beneficial interest asset2 as well as any future data breach-related expenses, which are not expected to be material. | Year-to-date net pre-tax data breach expenses of $140 million, or (14) cents per share2; | GAAP EPS guidance does not include an estimate of future data breach-related expenses, which are not expected to be material in any individual period. | 1Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”), a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain matters not related to the Company’s ongoing retail operations, such as data breach expenses, losses associated with the early retirement of debt, the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and impairment losses. 2See the “Accounting Considerations” section of this release for additional information about expenses related to the data breach and the beneficial interest asset.   | During fourth quarter 2013, Target experienced a data breach in which an intruder gained unauthorized access to its network and stole certain payment card and other guest information. In third quarter 2014, the Company incurred breach-related expenses of $12 million. Since the data breach in fourth quarter 2013, the Company has incurred total net breach-related expenses of $158 million, reflecting $248 million of gross expenses, partially offset by the recognition of a $90 million insurance receivable. These expenses include an accrual for estimated probable losses for what the Company believes to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by payment card networks. Given the varying stages of claims and related proceedings and the inherent uncertainty surrounding them, the Company’s estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, historical precedents and an assessment of the validity of certain claims. These estimates may change as new information becomes available and, although the Company does not believe it is probable, it is reasonably possible that the Company may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued. The Company is unable to estimate the amount of such reasonably possible excess loss exposure at this time. The accrual does not reflect future breach-related legal, consulting or administrative fees, which are expensed as incurred and not expected to be material in any individual period. | Statements in this release regarding fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings guidance and excess exposure related to the data breach are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements speak only as of the date they are made and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially. The most important risks and uncertainties are described in Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014 and Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended August 2, 2014. | To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS), which excludes the impact of the 2013 sale of our U.S. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, the loss on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach and other matters presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our ongoing retail operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.
