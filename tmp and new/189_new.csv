"002508, 005930, 1088...",Barron's Summary,25-Nov-17,SA,,"Conjecture, Media Summaries, Barron's Summary, Published Reports","International Trader (Europe):  Positive on Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.GR), as the container shipping industry appears to be enjoying its best conditions in nearly a decade. Global trade volume is up 4.3% this year, even as protectionism re-emerges as a threat. The 2016 bankruptcy filing of Hanjin Shipping took vessels off the market and sparked more consolidation and alliances. Hapag-Lloyd's relatively low valuation and strong fleet make it a promising way to play the revival. International Trader (Asia):  Positive on Tencent Holdings (700.HK), whose shares have climbed 125% this year to become the world's fifth-largest listed company. Shares could continue to surge as long as the company can continue to deliver on earnings and widen its moat, with its growing financial-technology business leading the way. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam has a current price target of $62.99, or 18% upside after Friday's comeback. Current Yield:  Emerging market bonds have had an impressive recovery after selling off after the U.S. presidential election. The selloff was driven by fears of inflation, rising rates, and a more isolationist trade policy. Markets have shrugged off these concerns, and the trend could continue into 2018, helped by improving global growth, benign inflation, and central banks that continue to suppress interest rates. The Striking Price:  Shares of Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) set 52- week highs last week, likely reflecting expectations that the launch of Bitcoin futures will be lucrative for the exchanges. Barron's is concerned over the decision to pursure Bitcoin futures, as it may not be in the interest of the derivatives market. Until it is known if Bitcoin futures will be segregated at clearing firms to protect the stability of the markets, Barron's doesn't recommend Cboe or CME as anything but momentum trades. Commodities Corner: A cold spell in December could lift winter wheat prices higher than $5 a bushel, up more than a dollar from recent prices. A rally would aid the ailing farm economy, which has been hurt by steadily falling wheat prices since 2012. Fertilizer makers Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium (AGU) are two ways to wager such a move. Insider Transactions:  A list of recent purchases and sales of U.S. companies made by insiders. Up And Down Wall Street:  Janet Yellen last week expressed concern that inflation might continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% target. But a new leading indicator of inflation shows prices rising at nearly a 3% yearly pace, which raises the question: is Yellen concerned about prices that consumers pay, or does she fear a slide in inflated asset prices resulting from the Fed's tightening policy? The Fed faces a conundrum, as it must weigh rising inflation pressures against the risk posed by high -- and arguably inflated -- asset prices. Streetwise: Last week, +UBER said it had suffered a data breach resulting in the theft of information of about 57 million customers; worse yet, the company sat on the information for a year, and paid a $100k ransom for the hackers to hide the breach. Uber has a history of playing by its own set of private rules, free from the onus of public company disclosures. If a private company as large as Uber is serious about transparency and honesty, it should choose to report like a public company. Technology Trader:  Cloud technology is rapidly evolving in a way that could either cement or erode the oligarchy of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT),  and Alphabet (GOOGL). A new way of writing software called ""serverless software"" makes it easier for programmers to use cloud computing generally, which is good for these companies; but it can also weaken a programmer's loyalty to any one cloud, which could weaken the grip of the oligarchs. The three leaders are trailed by IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL). Speaking of Dividends:  Tax inversions enable a U.S. corporation to acquire a foreign company and then reincorporate overseas. A recent bill that made it out of the Senate Finance Committee would tax the dividends of inverted companies at a much higher rate than currently. Among U.S. companies that have done inversions are Medtronic (MDT), Eaton (ETN), Allergan (AGN), Johnson Controls International (JCI), Mylan (MYL), and Endo International (ENDP).",1,694,data breach

"EEFT, MGI",President of Ant Financial discusses Euronet and its Hostile Proposal for MoneyGram,12-Apr-17,SA,,"Mergers and Acquisitions, M&A Other Announcements  Related Stories:","Euronet has sought to create phantom national security arguments and encouraged political interference in a commercial transaction. A closer examination of Euronet's self-serving claims demonstrates that its hostile bid for MoneyGram does nothing to advance American interests. There is a reason the company is named ""Euronet"" – its operations are far from being American; rather they are primarily in Eastern Europe where the company was founded and is still heavily concentrated. Over 85% of its assets are outside of the U.S. At its U.S. headquarters, it has just 150 employees according to the Kansas City Business Journal. Nearly all of Euronet's servers and data centers where its customer information resides are located outside of the U.S., according to public filings. Euronet has just two data facilities in the U.S. Euronet was recently fined millions of dollars by regulators for a massive data breach that exposed more than 2M credit card accounts, which raises real questions about its data security. Euronet derives only 28% of its revenue in the U.S. and pays virtually no tax in the U.S., according to its annual report to shareholders. Last year, Euronet paid zero U.S. tax and over the last decade only 4% of all taxes paid were paid in the U.S. Further, Euronet has disclosed it has been penalized by tax authorities for underpaying taxes. In March of this year, Euronet announced it has no intention to bring its profits to the U.S. where it would have to pay taxes. Euronet has told investors it plans to cut $60M in costs if it acquires MoneyGram, which would inevitably impact U.S. facilities and employment, leading to significant U.S. job cuts. Euronet's acquisition of MoneyGram would reduce competition by consolidating the industry from three U.S. players to two. Ant Financial's acquisition of MoneyGram will preserve three U.S. players and through Ant Financial's significant investment and expansion plans, enhance competition, which will benefit U.S. consumers.",1,318,data breach
