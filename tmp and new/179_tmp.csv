CtW stated that it seemed that the board and management failed to protect the company's reputation as  a credit reporting agency, its most important asset. CtW claimed that the company should separate the roles of CEO  and Chairman, revise its clawback policy, remove the Chairmen of the Audit Committee and Technology Committee,  have the Special Committee of the board created for the data breach review the financial impact of the data breach  and review the company's cybersecurity response plans, and create a multi-stakeholder advisory council to address  concerns related to data security practices. CtW further claimed that if the board failed to address the damage of the  security breach, it might not be able to support the re-election of its directors at the next annual meeting. | On 12-5-2017, The Shareholders Foundation, Inc. announced that Equifax faced a pending lawsuit for certain  purchasers of its shares in connection with the company's recent data breach, pursuant to which, on 9-11-2017, a  lawsuit was filed against Equifax over alleged securities violations. | On 4-11-2018, CtW filed a notice of exempt solicitation and urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of  John McKinley, Mark B. Templeton and Mark L. Feidler to the board, at the 2018 annual meeting. CtW stated that  votes against the three directors were warranted due to their long-term membership on the Technology Committee,  failure to act despite repeated warnings and known risks, poor crisis management, and weak supervision of  Equifax's compliance obligation. CtW noted belief that greater broad accountability was required following the weak  cybersecurity practices and inadequate internal control monitoring that led up to Equifax's 2017 data breach, which  resulted to billions in losses for the company.",3,"160, 42, 109",data breach,EFX - Equifax Inc.

Robbins Geller and Hagens Berman, two of the nation’s most successful firms specializing in nationwide class-action cases on behalf of consumers and investors, are fighting for reimbursement and genuine protection from identity theft for consumers with a legal team including experts in data breach class actions and former federal prosecutors, including a former federal cyber-prosecutor. | Hagens Berman attorneys developed a comprehensive Equifax data breach FAQ for those affected by the hack, where they answer key questions about protecting your identity, the lawsuit, and what consumers can expect from a class-action lawsuit against Equifax. The firms’ comprehensive lawsuit seeks to make affected consumers whole and seeks remedies for Equifax’s negligence and violations of 62 state consumer protection and data breach laws. Find out your rights. | “The massive data breach could have been prevented and should have been detected and disclosed earlier,” the suit states. | Paul Geller, founding partner and the head of Robbins Geller’s Consumer Fraud and Multi-District Litigation Practice Group who has led many class actions involving data breaches and privacy laws, said, “The scope and breath of this security breach is staggering. Equifax collects and stores private data on millions of Americans every day, and its failure to protect that data from hackers shocks the conscience.” | Steve Berman, Hagens Berman’s managing partner stated: “It’s ironic that one of the largest sellers of identity theft protection, itself disregarded the basic and industry standard practice of installing security patches. This data breach will have devastating and long-lasting repercussions for nearly half the adult population of the United States.” | Stuart Davidson, the partner at Robbins Geller leading its data breach practice added: “Equifax recently boasted more than $3.1 billion in revenue and nearly $1 billion in profits in its 2016 annual report. It clearly had the resources to make sure that all available security patches were promptly installed, and had it done so, it would have prevented this massive breach of the most sensitive data belonging to 143 million consumers.” | The suit details that for two months before the data breach started, Equifax had notice of the software vulnerability that hackers exploited. Despite press reports of widespread use of this vulnerability, Equifax failed to install an available patch or take its vulnerable systems offline. | Loeser, who prosecuted hackers for data breach crimes when he worked for the Department of Justice, explained: “While consumers can readily change credit card account numbers and close vulnerable bank accounts, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers are usually permanent and difficult and costly to change. This means that criminals and identity thieves can wait months, years, even decades, before using the stolen information to open loans, obtain credit cards, and file false federal tax returns in unsuspecting victims’ names.” | Teaming up to litigate what is by large measure the largest data breach ever stemmed from the two firms’ past working relationship and mutual respect. According to Geller, “our firms each have the human and financial resources to take on the largest and most powerful corporations, and we’ve each achieved some of the most significant class action recoveries in history. As a pairing, we’re a formidable team that is laser focused on achieving real justice for the public.”",10,"24, 78, 69, 19, 64, 50, 71, 44, 81, 78",data breach,EFX - Robbins Geller and Hagens Berman File Comprehensive Multi-State Class Action Lawsuit Against Equifax for Massive Data Breach - 22-Sep-17 - BW.pdf
