Companies that tolerate or cover up sexual harassment, perpetuate a culture that fosters it, or fail to provide avenues for employees to report concerns or incidents, could see their bottom lines take a hit from difficulties attracting and retaining talented employees, customer defections, or ruined deals.

http://ir.mondelezinternational.com/common/download/download.cfm?CompanyID=AMDA-,Company Announcements and Releases,"DEERFIELD, Ill. – June 4, 2013 – Mondelēz International, Inc., (NASDAQ: MDLZ) the world’s largest chocolate company with billion-dollar brands such as  Milka and Cadbury , and global favorites Toblerone and Lacta, today announced an agreement with the Ivorian government’s Conseil du Café Cacao (CCC) to help farmers increase sustainable cocoa production and create thriving communities in Côte d’Ivoire.  Non- governmental organization CARE International will lead Cocoa Life projects in Ivorian cocoa communities through 2016.   “A sustainable cocoa supply begins with thriving farming communities, and more efficient farming leads to farmers’ financial security,” said Christine M. McGrath, Vice President of External Affairs and Cocoa Life at Mondelēz International.  “Partnering is key to creating lasting change through our Cocoa Life program, and together with the Ivorian government and CARE International, we’re empowering cocoa farming families to create the kind of communities they and their children want to live in, while promoting gender equality.”    As part of the agreement, Mondelēz International’s Cocoa Life has begun a pilot program in Côte d’Ivoire with CARE International working in 11 villages to help nearly 4,000 farmers boost their cocoa-growing productivity and improve the livelihoods of nearly 40,000 community members.  Cocoa Life and CARE have already organized community meetings where farming families discuss their needs and priorities and create Community Action Plans to achieve specific development outcomes, such as expanding farmer field schools on cocoa growing.  As gender equality is a key pillar of Cocoa Life, the program has held specific meetings for women farmers so their voices are heard in cocoa communities.  Cocoa Life plans to get women more involved in farmer training, farming co-ops and community life, while providing them access to more diversified livelihoods to complement farming.    “At CARE, we know that business can play a vital role in tackling poverty and injustice,” said Balla Sidibe, Country Director of CARE International in Cote d’Ivoire. “For a company like Mondelēz International, that means seeing poor people as vital stakeholders in their long-term success by putting farmers and communities at the heart of their supply chain.  By working together on Cocoa Life, we look forward to leveraging our experience and understanding of disadvantaged farmers from poor communities to bring about lasting for communities across Cote d’Ivoire and for the long-term benefit of the business itself.”  Cocoa Life also plans to work with the Ivorian government’s agronomic research arm – CNRA - to fight crop diseases affecting cocoa trees, which has recently impacted cocoa farmers in Côte d’Ivoire.  Mondelēz International’s research and development team is sharing its cocoa-growing know-how to help CNRA develop more productive and disease-resistant cocoa trees.  Recently, the company’s global Research & Development team spent a week in Côte d’Ivoire to lend its expertise. The group met with local experts to better understand specific, local challenges in the market and how to better collaborate and expand their work.  Separately, Mondelēz International plans to collaborate with ANANDER - the Ivorian agricultural extension agency - to boost its farmer training programs.   Mondelēz International’s collaboration in Côte d’Ivoire is an important milestone for its Cocoa Life program, which last November made a $100 million commitment to help 75,000 Ivorian farmers double their productivity.  In total, Cocoa Life is a $400 million, 10-year commitment to improve the livelihoods and living conditions of more than 200,000 cocoa farmers and about one million people in cocoa farming communities around the world.   Cocoalife.org Website Will Share Farmers’ Stories and Increase Transparency Mondelēz International recently launched www.cocoalife.org to empower farmers to share their stories.  The site will serve as a platform for increased reporting and transparency to share progress against goals and measures for success.

Cocoa Life and CARE have already organized community meetings where farming families discuss their needs and priorities and create Community Action Plans to achieve specific development outcomes, such as expanding farmer field schools on cocoa growing.

If the report related to local management, it was followed up by the central integrity officer and Global Business Risk & Audit. Due to the COVID-19 restrictions certain investigations had to be performed remotely, and not all could be followed up as efficiently or quickly as usual. All proven reports were followed up by corrective action, which varied depending on the facts. Corrective action included additional training, coaching and/or monitoring for the people involved, as well as enhanced communication and improved controls on relevant policies and procedures; this was especially relevant in cases of non- compliance with internal policies and procedures and improper management practices. In intimidation, harassment and sexual harassment cases, the corrective action varied from a written warning and further coaching to other disciplinary action and termination of employment.

By forging links with local community stakeholders, including public, private, NGO, and institutional partnerships, we stimulate equity, diversity and inclusion in the workplace. For example, our Randstad Institute in France and our foundations in Germany and Spain provide access to employment for disadvantaged groups, such as immigrant workers, women at risk, victims of domestic violence, single parents, older workers, and the long-term unemployed. Addressing the challenges that the growing number of older workers face in entering, re-entering, or staying active in the workforce is also part of our approach to furthering employment market sustainability. In 2020, around 259,000 of the candidates working in our main markets were older than 50. In addition, in several of our main (mostly European) markets, we placed around 21,500 people who had been unemployed for more than one year, and almost 86,000 with no educational degree. | provider, Randstad specifically contributes to four goals: decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), gender equality (SDG 5), and quality education (SDG 4). | Boards reflect the diverse nature of the environment in which Randstad and its stakeholders operate, and improve their effectiveness.

We are working toward a world where everyone, regardless of race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, ability or any other characteristic, has equal access to opportunities and feels valued and respected. Our diversity pushes us forward as a company and as a team. Diverse ideas, cultures, and perspectives break down subconscious barriers and help build a team of more well-rounded employees.

As a result, these forms of work often still lack appropriate and fair regulation and social protection, which may also lead to an unnecessarily large informal labor market. According to the International Labour Organization’s World Employment and Social Outlook, which analyses key labor market issues, 61% of the global workforce are employed informally, without access to any form of security in their career. Furthermore, half a billion people across the world are affected by labor underutilization, including the unemployed, the underemployed and those who lack sufficient access to labor markets. The number of underemployed people (165 million) is nearly as high as the number of unemployed (188 million). In addition, 276 million young people (aged 15-24) are neither in employment, education nor training (NEET). This underscores the need for a global drive to get the social innovation agenda implemented. It requires the smart combination of measures that appropriately regulate a diversity of work forms (valued by both workers and businesses) and provide unrestricted access to social security and skilling. | From a broader perspective, we work to ensure the well- being of talent by addressing the importance of decent work and a healthy working and living environment with clients, governments and other local authorities.

We do not discriminate on the grounds of age, skin color, disability, gender, marital status, nationality, race, religion, or sexual orientation, and we have a non-discrimination policy to underline this.
