And in 99 percent 2 of domestic violence cases, victims will also experience financial abuse, which means their abusers deny them access to money, ruin their credit by stealing their identity or harass them at work so they lose their jobs. Financial abuse is the No. 1 reason victims stay in or return to abusive relationships. Allstate Foundation Purple Purse aims to create long-term safety and security for domestic violence survivors through financial empowerment. | The designer handbags will be available for auction throughout October, which is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Details on the auctions will be announced in the coming weeks on Washington's Twitter page (@kerrywashington) and Purple Purse's Facebook page (facebook.com/purplepurse).

The program has propelled more than 800,000 survivors on the road to safety through its tools, including the Moving Ahead Through Financial Management  curriculum, which equips women with the knowledge necessary to regain their financial independence. To date, The Allstate Foundation has invested more than $50 million to help educate the public about financial abuse and offer critical survivor services, including financial education, asset-building, job training and readiness programs.   | On an average day in 2015, more than 12,000 requests from victims for services such as emergency shelter and financial assistance went unanswered due to a lack of funding at domestic violence programs across the country.

It shines a light on the role financial abuse plays in keeping women trapped in domestic violence situations and explores how people react when faced with an opportunity to help a victim. | ""Our purpose at Allstate is to help people live their best lives, and that means continuing to raise awareness of domestic violence and empowering survivors to regain their financial independence,"" said Vicky Dinges, Allstate's senior vice president of corporate responsibility.  ""We are thrilled to welcome Serena, a longtime advocate and role model for so many, to the Purple Purse family. Her voice will bring new audiences into this critical conversation.
